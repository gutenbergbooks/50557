CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry the Seventh</span> sat upon the throne.</p>

<p>The town of Middle Forest had long since
pushed the forest from all sides. Its streets,
forked as lightning, ran up to the castle and down
to the river. The river here was near its mouth,
and wide. The bridge that crossed it had many
arches. Below the bridge quite large craft, white
and brown and dull red, sailed or dropping sail,
came to anchor. Answering to hour and weather
the water spread carnation, gold, sapphire, jade,
opal, lead and ebony. Now it slept glassy, and
now wind made of it a fretful, ridged thing. The
note of the town was a bleached grey, but with
strong splashes of red and umber. A sharp,
steep hill upheld the castle that was of middle
size and importance, built by the lords Montjoy
and held now by William of that name.</p>

<p>Behind the town a downward sloping wood
tied the castle hill to fields and meadows. The
small river Wander ran by these on its way to
join the greater stream. Up the Wander, two
leagues or so, in a fertile vale couched the Abbey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of Silver Cross. Materially speaking, a knot of
stone houses for monks&mdash;Cistercians, White
Monks&mdash;a stately stone house for God and his
Son and Mary; near-by a quite unstately hamlet,
timber, daub and thatch, grown haphazard by
church and cloister; many score broad acres,
wood and field, stream and pasture, mill, forge,
weirs, and a tenant roll of goodly length,&mdash;such
was Silver Cross. So far as physical possessions
went what in this region Montjoy did not hold
Silver Cross did and what the two did not hold
Middle Forest had managed to wrest from them
in Henry Sixth’s time. Silver Cross had, too,
immaterial possessions. But once she had been
wealthier here than she was now. That time had
been even with a time of material poverty. Now
she had goods, but she did not have so much sanctity.
Yet there were values still, marked with that
other world’s seal; it is useless to doubt that.</p>

<p>The thorn in Silver Cross’ flesh was not now
Montjoy nor Middle Forest, with both of whom
she had for years lived in amity. The thorn was
the Friary of Saint Leofric&mdash;Dominican&mdash;across
the river from Middle Forest, but tied to
it by the bridge, holding its lands well away from
Montjoy and Silver Cross, but rival nevertheless,
with an eye to king’s favour, cardinal’s favour,
and bidding latterly, with a distinctness, for popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
favour. That was the wretched, irritating
thorn, likely to produce inflammation! Prior
Hugh of Saint Leofric&mdash;ah, the ambitious one!</p>

<p>Silver Cross possessed in a splendid <i>loculus</i> the
span-long silver cross that the lips of Saint Willebrod,
the martyr, had kissed after head and trunk
were parted. In ancient times it had worked
many miracles, but in this modern day the miraculous
was grown drowsy. Saint Leofric had the
bones of Saint Leofric,&mdash;all, that is, save the
right hand and arm. That is, once and for ages
these had lacked. But now&mdash;this very Easter&mdash;the
missing members had been found: miraculously
pointed out, miraculously found! There
had been long pause in working miracles, but now
Saint Leofric was working them again. Middle
Forest talked more of Saint Leofric who was, as
it were, a foreigner, being across the river, lord
of nothing on this side&mdash;than it talked of Silver
Cross that was its own. Not alone Middle Forest,
but all this slice of England. Silver Cross found
the mounting bruit discordant, a very peacock
scream. Silver Cross slurred the fresh miracles
of Saint Leofric and detested Prior Hugh. Silver
Cross’s own abbot, Abbot Mark, said that
Apollyon made somewhere a market.</p>

<p>The river lay stretched and still, red with the
sunset, deep blue where the blue summer sky yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
abided. “Like the Blessed Virgin’s robe and
cloak!” said Morgen Fay. “The bridge is her
gemmed girdle.”</p>

<p>Morgen Fay’s house was a river-side one, built
up sheer indeed from the river so that one might
take welcomes, flung toys, from passing boats.
Morgen Fay took them, leaning from her window.
Her voice floated down in return; sometimes she
flung a flower. She had a garden, large as a
kerchief, beside the house, hidden almost by a
jut of the old town wall. Here she gathered the
flowers she flung. Sometimes he who had been in
the boat came again, walking, to her door that was
discreet, in the shadow of the wall. But he only
gained entry if he were somehow friend of a
friend. And all alike must be <i>armiger</i>, or at least
not the least in the burgher world. And, logically,
only those of these entered who could be friends
and pay. Would you have love for nothing? She
had an answer always ready to that. “I must
live!”</p>

<p>The sunset spread. There was more red than
blue. “She is so close wrapped in her mantle that
you can hardly see the heavenly blue core of her.&mdash;Oh,
Mother and Mother and Mother&mdash;where
are we and what are we?”</p>

<p>Morgen Fay went into her garden. Company
was coming for supper. Best break a few more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
flowers. The flowers were June flowers, roses
and yellow lilies, larkspur and pinks. They had
the sunset hues. The owner of the garden broke
them, tall herself as the lilies, white and vermeil
like the roses.</p>

<p>The sunset died out and the river stretched first
pearl and then lead and then ebony.</p>

<p>Morgen Fay had a little oaken room where
boards were laid upon trestles and covered with a
fringed cloth, and dishes and flasks and goblets
set upon this. An old woman, large but light
upon her feet, spread the table, Morgen helping.
The old woman’s son kept the street door. He
was a lazy lout but obedient, strong, too, of his
fists and with a voice that could summon, if need
were, not the dead but the watch. His name was
Anthony, the old woman’s Ailsa, and Morgen
Fay had known them since she was a young child.
Now they were in her employ.</p>

<p>Said Ailsa, “’Tis Somerville’s company?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You know that. How many candles?
You’d best bring three more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. Is that the gown you’re going to
wear?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s my best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s not the one you like the best&mdash;so ’t isn’t
your best after all, is it? You don’t like Somerville
as well as you did last Lady Day.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter if I like him or don’t like
him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t keep him if you don’t like him!
He’ll go as others have gone. ‘Keep!’ Lord!
With most of blessed women it’s the other way
’round!”</p>

<p>She brought the candles. “Do you like Master
Bettany?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He’s richer than the knight&mdash;just as he’s
younger. I say that Somerville’s holding a light
for his own house’s sacking!”</p>

<p>“I say that I am tired. I like neither man nor
woman, I nor thou.”</p>

<p>“Are you cold? Will you have a little fire?
Here, take wine!”</p>

<p>“Joy from wine is falseness like the rest.
Give it to me!”</p>

<p>Morgen drank. “I’ll have just time to put on
the other dress if you think it sets me better.”</p>

<p>She went and put it on, returning to the oak
room. Ailsa regarded results with eyes of a
friendly critic. “It does! Montjoy knows how
to choose&mdash;learned it, I reckon, in France!”
She stood with her hands on her hips. She, too,
had taken wine and now she loosed tongue, regarding
all the time the younger woman with a
selfish and unselfish affection, submitting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
wonder of her, but standing up for the right by
prescription of half-ruling the wonder. Morgen
had a voice of frankincense and music with a drop
of clear oil. Ailsa had more of the oil and a humbler
music. “Say you ‘Falseness?’ Say you
‘Coldness?’ Say you ‘Darkness!’ You’re a
bright fool, Morgen-live-by-the-river!”</p>

<p>“Granted I am a fool,” said Morgen, and
kneeled on the window seat.</p>

<p>The older woman’s voice rose. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>“Doesn’t fire
warm you, and good sweet sack? Don’t you lie
soft? Don’t you have jewels and gold work and
silk of Cyprus? Don’t gentlemen and rich merchants
come for your stroking? Haven’t you got
a garden where you can walk and a tight house,
and a pearl net for your hair, and a velvet shoe?
Doesn’t Montjoy protect you for old time’s sake&mdash;even
though now the fool goes off after religion?
Religion! Don’t you go to Mass and
give candles&mdash;wax ones&mdash;and doesn’t Father
Edwin, your cousin, make all safe for you in that
quarter? Oh, the Saints! There’s king’s power,
and there’s priest’s power, and there’s woman’s
power! World slurs you and world loves you,
Morgen and Morgen! Go to! Fie on you!
Shorten your long face! Where’s falseness&mdash;anything
to speak of, that is? Where’s coldness
and darkness? The world’s been a good world
to you, mistress, ever since you danced at the
Great Fair here, and Warham House saw you
and took you and taught you! A pretty good
world!”</p>

<p>“As worlds go&mdash;poor, dumb things! Yes, I
say they are poor, dumb things! Light the
candles!”</p>

<p>The large woman drew close the curtains over
the window that gave upon the street and lighted
the candles. There was wood laid within the fireplace.
She regarded this. “It’s a cool June&mdash;and,
Our Lady! we seem to need mirth here to-night!
Fire and wine&mdash;wine and fire!”</p>

<p>She left the room for the kitchen, and returning
with a flaming brand, struck it amid the cold
wood. All took fire. “Better, isn’t it? I hear
company’s footfall!”</p>

<p>The company thought the oak room shining to-night.
They thought Morgen Fay fair and joyous.
Sir Robert Somerville was yet in love,&mdash;none
of her old loves went wholly out of love. But
he was not so fathoms deep in love as once he had
been. He had left the miser stage and now he was
at the expansive, willing to feed pride by showing
his easy wealth. He moved a tall man of forty-odd,
with a quick, odd grimacing face, not unpleasing.
He had a decisive voice and more gesture
than was the country’s custom. With him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
came a guest in his house to whom he wished to
show the oak casket and the gem it contained, a
cousin from the other side of England, Sir Humphrey
Somerville, to wit,&mdash;and Master Thomas
Bettany, son and heir of the richest merchant
in Middle Forest. They kissed Morgen Fay who
put on magic and welcomed them. It was as
though the river outside, that had been lead to
ebony, ran now through faint silver back to rose.</p>

<p>There was a settle by the fire and Morgen sat
here, and by her Sir Robert, and Sir Humphrey
opposite, and Master Bettany in a poorer chair in
front of the flames. Master Bettany was the
youngest there,&mdash;a great, blond boy with blue
eyes of daring, with enormous desire for adventure,
experience, plots and mysteries. Salt and
sugar must be elaborately planned for, approached
with a delicate, shivering sense of danger,
of play and play again and something to risk,
or truly life was not sugared nor salted! He was
for islands said to be danger-circled and with a
witch for queen! He was likewise modest and
kind-hearted, and as he could not devise evil, the
evil he believed in was highly artificial. Sir
Humphrey Somerville was as large for man as
Ailsa was for women. He had brown hair and
a beak of a nose and the eyes of a wag, but behind
the waggery something formidable in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Such as they were, they had a merry evening,
when the food was brought and the wine was
poured; and Morgen, too, turned merry, though,
as ever, she kept measure, for that was the way
she ruled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> in the castle also was company to supper.
William, Lord of Montjoy, entertained his cousin,
Abbot Mark from Silver Cross, and Prior Matthew
of Westforest, a dependent House further
up the Wander. Montjoy showed a small, dark,
wistful man. The Abbot had too much flesh for
comfort, a great, handsome, egg-shaped face, and
a manner that oozed bland, undoubting authority.
He had long ago settled that he was good and
wise. But, strangely, was left the struggle to be
happy! It took a man’s time! Just there, something
or some one perpetually interfered! But
it was something to be sure that you served God
and Holy Church. Asked how he served, he
might, after cogitation, have answered that he
served by his being. Moreover, as times went, he
was scrupulous, gave small houseroom to scandal,
ruled monk and tenant, beautified the great
church of Silver Cross, bought Italian altar pictures.</p>

<p>Matthew of Westforest was another sort. Tall
and shrivelled and reddish, he had another manner
of wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The three supped in the castle hall, at the upper
end of a table accommodating a half-score above
the salt and thrice that number below. Beside
Montjoy sat Lady Alice, his wife. There were
likewise a young girl, his daughter Isabel, and his
sister, also young, married and widowed, Dame
Elenore.</p>

<p>Abbot Mark talked much to these three, benevolently,
with gallantry looking around corners.
The Prior maintained silence here. The features
he secretly praised were the beautiful features
of Outward Advancement. Montjoy at supper
talked little. After a life of apparent unconcern
he was beginning to think of soul’s life. Perhaps
once a day he felt a shift of consciousness. Now
it came like a zephyr from some differing, surely
sweeter clime, and now like a clean dagger stroke.
After these events, which never took more time
to happen than the winking of an eye, he saw
some great expanse of things differently. He was
learning to lie in wait for these instants. Laid
one to another, they were becoming the hub
around which the day’s wheel ran. But truly they
were but instants and came but once in so often,
taking him when it pleased them. And the lightning
might have showed him&mdash;perhaps did show
him&mdash;that there was an unknown number of
things yet to change. They might be very many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
He knew in no wise definitely whence came the
fragrant air and the dagger strokes.</p>

<p>At the moment when the chronicle opens, he
had turned back, in his questing, to the broad
realm of Holy Church. Holy Church said that
she sat, acquiescent, wise, at the door through
which such things came. In fact, she said, she
had the keys. Montjoy, being no fool, saw, indeed,
how much of the portress was lewd and
drunken. But for all that surely she had been
given the keys! Given them once, surely she
could not have parted with them! He rebuked
the notion. And truly he knew much that was
good of the portress, much that was very good.
He thought, “I will better serve Religion”&mdash;conceiving
that to be Holy Church’s high name.
But he was bewildered between high name and
low name, between the saint there in the portress
and the evident harlot. Between the goodness
and the evil!</p>

<p>He was led by a longing for union and he only
knew that it was not for old unions that once had
contented. He could have those at any time if he
willed them again. But he knew that they would
not content. The longing was larger and demanded
a larger reciprocal. He was knight-errant
now in the interior land of romance, out
to find that reciprocal, visited with gleams from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
some presence, but wandering often, turning in
mistake now here, now there.</p>

<p>Supper ended. Abbot Mark had come to the
castle for counsel, or at the least, for intelligent
sympathy. It was too general in the hall. The
withdrawing room would be better. They went
to this, but still there was play, with a fire for a
cool June evening, with lights and musical instruments,
Dame Elenore’s hands upon the virginals,
young Isabel’s fresh voice singing with a young
knight, man of Montjoy’s, two gentlewomen serving
Lady Alice murmuring over a tapestry frame,&mdash;and
the Abbot soothed, happy, in the great
chair near Dame Elenore. Prior Matthew shook
himself. “Business! Business!” was his true
motto and inner word. He spoke in a low voice
to the Abbot, deferentially, for the Priory deduced
from the Abbey, but monitory also, perhaps
even minatory. Abbot and Prior alike knew that
when it came to business the Prior had the head.</p>

<p>The Abbot sighed and turned from Dame
Elenore to Montjoy who was brooding, chin on
fist, eyes on fire. “We must ride early to Silver
Cross, Montjoy! Counsel is good, they say,
taken in the warm, still hour before bedtime.”</p>

<p>Dame Elenore lifted her hands from the virginals.
Montjoy’s wife spoke to her women and,
the song being done, to her daughter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>“We will
go, my lord. Give you good night! Your blessing,
Lord Abbot!” She kneeled for it, as did
young Isabel and Dame Elenore and the two
gentlewomen and the young knight and Gilbert
the page. The Abbot blessed; the women and the
young men took their departure. Montjoy and
Silver Cross and Westforest had the room and
the fire and through the window the view, did
they choose to regard it, of the town roofs and
twisting, crack-like streets, and of the river, now
under the gleaming of a rising moon, and a line
that was the bridge, and a mound on the farther
side crowned by a twinkling constellation, lights
of Saint Leofric’s monks. The Abbot did so look,
walking heavily the room and pausing by the window.
It was with peevish face and gesture that
he returned to the great chair “Do you hear each
day, Montjoy, louder news of what Hugh is doing?”</p>

<p>“Is it Prior Hugh, or is it Saint Leofric? If
it be Hugh, I say that long since we knew that he
was ambitious and glory-covetous. If it be the
saint&mdash;how shall you war against him?”</p>

<p>“If Saint Willebrod would arise to war&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Would they war&mdash;two saints?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would he not come to aid of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Robert, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bernard, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen and Abbey of Silver Cross?
Just as Montjoy would draw blade for his suzerain?
Chivalry, loyalty and fealty must hold in
heaven,” said the Abbot.</p>

<p>“If there is One behind Saint Leofric&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never believe it!” The Prior spoke hastily.
“Moreover, my son, it is certainly not Leofric.
It is Hugh!”</p>

<p>Montjoy sat brooding. His guests watched
him. Presently he spoke. “Two days ago, returning
from hawking in Long Fields, I met a
man who had sat and woven baskets from his
youth because he could not walk, being smitten in
both feet. He was walking, he was skipping and
running. ‘Saint Leofric! Saint Leofric!’ he
kept crying out, and those with him cried, ‘Saint
Leofric! Saint Leofric!’ I halted one of them.
‘The right hand and arm&mdash;the right hand and
arm that were found, lord! He touched but the
little finger&mdash;and look how he leaps and runs!’”</p>

<p>The Abbot groaned.</p>

<p>“I rode on farther and I met a stream of folk
on their way to the bridge. They had made themselves
into a procession and were chanting. I remember
easily and I can almost give you their
chant. It ran something like this.”</p>

<p>He began to chant, but not loudly.</p>

<p>“I should not have said it&mdash;I should not have
said it!” cried the Abbot. “But with the inconstant
and weak generality it doth! What is it this
part England rings with&mdash;yea, that the rest of
England begins to learn? Do we not hear that a
pilgrimage comes from London itself? <em>The
missing bones of Saint Leofric have been
found!</em>”</p>

<p>“And have they not?” said Montjoy.</p>

<p>There followed a pause. A log cracked and fell
upon the hearth. Light and shadow leaped about
the room. The Prior spoke. “It is a matter of
observation,” he said, and seemed to study his
ring, “that there are cases when acts belief as
belief, whether it be correctly addressed to a
reality or squandered before a falsity.”</p>

<p>“I have met that witch,” answered Montjoy,
“and she palsies me!” He went to the window
and stood looking out at the moon-silvered town
and river. Presently back he came. “Against
what or whom do you shake a lance? If it be
against a saint and his true miracles, I lay the
quarrel down&mdash;”</p>

<p>Abbot Mark spoke weightily. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>“And so should
I, Montjoy, and so should I! But if it be against
falsity? If it be against Hugh and his frauds?”</p>

<p>“Prove that!”</p>

<p>The Abbot turned toward the Prior. The latter
nodded and spoke. “We brought with us two
wandering friars&mdash;Franciscans. Westforest has
known them long. They are not the idle and
greedy rogues that bring us down with the people.
They are right Mendicants, travelling from place
to place to do good. Will it please you have them
summoned?”</p>

<p>A silver bell stood upon the table. Montjoy
struck it. His page appeared, took commands
and bowing vanished. Abbot Mark began to
speak of the church at Silver Cross and how he
would make it so rich and beautiful! Now Montjoy
loved this church. Buried beneath it were
his parents, and buried his first young wife, the
one whom he loved as he did not love Dame Alice.
It was she he had loved through and beyond Morgen
Fay, loving something of her in that sinner
from whom, in concern for his soul, he had
parted. He listened to the Abbot. Certainly
Silver Cross was the highest, the most beauteous,
and must be kept so! He knew Silver Cross,
church and cloister, in and out, when he was a
boy and after. He had love and concern for it&mdash;love
almost of a lover&mdash;jealous love. Prior
Hugh and Saint Leofric must not go beyond
bounds!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The two friars entered, Andrew and Barnaby,
honest-looking men, Andrew the more intelligent.
They stood by the door with hands crossed and
Montjoy observed them. Given permission to
advance and speak they came discreetly, with
modesty, into conclave. Without preamble, they
began.</p>

<p>The Abbot spoke. “My sons, the Lord Montjoy
who hath ever been devout toward Saint
Willebrod and his Abbey of Silver Cross&mdash;yea,
who hath been, like his father before him, advocate
and protector and enricher of the same,
bringing from overseas emeralds, rubies and
sapphires for that marvel the casket where lies
that world’s marvel, the cross of Saint Willebrod&mdash;the
Lord Montjoy, my sons, would have from
your own lips that which you heard and saw in
April, it now being late June.&mdash;Question them,
Matthew, so that they may show it forth expeditiously.”</p>

<p>The Prior squared himself to the task.
“Where were you, my sons, two weeks before
Easter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Across the river, reverend father. The
granddame of Brother Barnaby here, living at
Damson Lane, was breathing her last and greatly
wishful to see him. She died&mdash;may her soul
rest&mdash;and we buried her. Then we would go a
little further, not having been upon yonder side
for some while.”</p>

<p>“You did not go brawling along, nor fled into
every alehouse as if Satan were after you?”</p>

<p>“Lord of Montjoy, we are not friars of that
stripe. We are clean men and sober, praise God
and Our Lady!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, they speak truth, Montjoy.&mdash;Well,
you walked in country over there, avoiding Friary
and town&mdash;if one can call that clump of mud,
pebble and thatch a town!”</p>

<p>“Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Brother Barnaby, lord, had had a dream. In
it a Shining One plucked up towns like weeds and
threw them one by one into a great and deep pit.
There was left alive only country road, heath and
field and wood. So he awoke quaking and said,
‘I go through never a town gate this journey!’”</p>

<p>“That was a discomfortable dream!”</p>

<p>The Abbot spoke. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>“I interpret it. The towns,
one by one, are that one which Hugh, dreaming
and dreaming again, thinks to see rise beside his
Friary, built from pilgrims’ wealth, with hostels
for pilgrims and merchants to sell them goods,
and a great house for nobles who come!&mdash;But a
Shining One, Hugh! topples them into ditches,
yea, into gulfs, as fast as you build them! Ha!
Go on, my son!”</p>

<p>“So we passed the town and we wandered, reverend
father, until we came to the chapel of Damson
Hill, three miles from Saint Leofric’s, where
the dead country folk lie under green grass.
Damson Wood is hard by, where watches and
prays the good hermit Gregory&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, a good man!” said Montjoy.</p>

<p>“By now the sun was setting. He gave us
water and bread, and after praying we lay down
to sleep with only our gowns for bed and bedding.
Brother Barnaby and I slept, but on the middle
of the night we waked. Then saw we the hermit
standing praying, and when he saw that we no
longer slept he said to us, ‘Misdoing is moving
through this night. Misdoing in high places!’
So he went to the door and stood a long time looking
out, then took his staff and strode forth, and
Brother Barnaby and I followed.”</p>

<p>“I know that he is said to have the greater
vision,” said Montjoy. “Moreover, once in my
life, he told me high truth.”</p>

<p>“Where did the holy man go, my son?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>“He went through the black night, reverend
father, to Damson Hill and to the great and ill-kept
graveyard under the shadow. Brother Barnaby
and I followed him. He walked softly and
he walked swiftly and he walked silently, and
when we came there we did not stop by the chapel
which truly is a ruin, but we went on to the far
slope of the yard&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Prior said, “Where they are buried who
died long since, of the plague that came in King
Richard’s time.”</p>

<p>“I know the place,” said Montjoy.</p>

<p>“Reverend father, there are three yew trees,
old, I reckon, as Damson Hill, and thick. Like
one who knows what he is about he passed within
the castle of these and we followed and made a
place whence we looked forth like eyes out of a
skull. And we saw, across the dead field, a little
light burning blue and coming toward us. Arm
of the hill hid it from the road. But had any belated
seen it he would most certainly have
thought, ‘A ghost among the graves!’ and taken
to his heels.”</p>

<p>“It came toward you. Who carried it?”</p>

<p>“One of six, reverend father. We were there
in the yew clump with less noise than maketh a
bat. They came closer and closer and at last they
came close, and now they did not shelter their lantern
for they thought, ‘The shoulder of the hill
and the yew trees hide, and who should be abroad
in this place in the black and middle night, and who
should know of a villainy working?’”</p>

<p>The Abbot brought his finger tips together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>“It is ever discovered!&mdash;They dig a pit and fall
into it; they open a grave and lift out their own
perdition!”</p>

<p>“They opened a grave?”</p>

<p>“Yes, lord. A very ancient, sunken one.”</p>

<p>“Some unknown,” said the Prior. “Some
wretch of ancient time, seized by the plague, dying&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;unshriven, lazar mayhap
or thief! Proceed, my son!”</p>

<p>“Two had spades. They spread a great cloth.
They lay the green turf to one side of this, and in
the middle the earth of the grave. They work
hard and they work fast, and a monk directs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Monk of Saint Leofric’s?”</p>

<p>“Aye, lord, Dominican. White-and-black.
They open the grave and they bring forth bones&mdash;the
frame of that perished one.”</p>

<p>The Abbot groaned. “Perished mayhap in his
sins&mdash;yea, almost certainly in his sins&mdash;and so
no better than heathen or than sorcerer!”</p>

<p>“They spread a second cloth, and having shaken
forth the earth, they put in it the bones of that obscure&mdash;yea,
right arm and hand with the
rest&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See you, Montjoy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, having that which they need, they fill in
the grave with care. They put over it the sod
they had taken away. Rain and sun must presently
make it whole. And probably no man hath
ever gone that way to look. So the six went away
as though they had moth wings, and now with no
light&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yet they give forth that right hand and arm
doth shine, giving light whereby a reading man
may read! Wherefore&mdash;oh, Hugh!&mdash;shone it
not by Damson Hill?”</p>

<p>Said Montjoy, “All this is enough to father
Suspicion, but the child must be named Certainty.”</p>

<p>“Then listen further!&mdash;Proceed, my son.
You two and the hermit followed?”</p>

<p>“We followed, reverend father. Under Damson
Hill those six parted, and three went by divers
ways, belike to their own dwellings. But the
three with the bones they had digged went Saint
Leofric’s road. We followed Blackfriar and his
fellows who would be lay brethren. The moon
shone out. We followed to Friary Gate and saw
them enter.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Gregory the hermit turned and went again to
Damson Wood, and we with him. When we
came to his cell there was red east.”</p>

<p>“What did you think of what you had seen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>“We could conceive naught, lord. We did not
know that which was to be proclaimed in Easter
week. But the hermit said thrice, ‘Villainy! Villainy!
Villainy! A shepherd hath turned villain!’”</p>

<p>Brother Barnaby came in. “He said besides,
‘I see what you cannot see, good brothers! But
dimly, and I cannot explain to myself what I
see.’”</p>

<p>“I had forgot that.”</p>

<p>“He said also. ‘Talk not, till you know of
what you are talking,’ and he took from us a
promise of silence.”</p>

<p>“I was coming to that, brother.&mdash;We are not
gabblers, reverend father. We left Damson
Wood and came down to the bridge and crossed
river to our own side. We said naught, remembering,
‘Talk not till you know of what you are
talking.’ Two days went by, and then near Little
Winching, up the Wander, down lay Brother
Barnaby with a fever, and I must nurse him for a
month. He, being very sick, forgot, and I being
busy and concerned, nigh forgot Damson Graveyard
and Saint Leofric’s Gate. Then, Brother
Barnaby getting well and we walking in a fair
morning to Little Winching, there meets us all
the bruit!”</p>

<p>“And still”&mdash;Brother Barnaby came in again&mdash;“we
said nothing. But it burned our hearts.
So said Brother Andrew, ‘We will go take this
thing to Prior Matthew of Westforest.’”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>“And so they did, according to right inner
counsel,” said the Prior. He turned in his chair.
“You may go now, my sons. But on your obedience,
speak as yet to none other of these things!”</p>

<p>Brother Andrew and Brother Barnaby craved
blessing, received it and vanished. There was
pause, then, “If we check not Hugh,” said the
Abbot, “we shall have loss and shame, being no
longer the first, the pupil of the eye, to this part
England!”</p>

<p>“If they spoke,” said Montjoy, “none would
believe them against the miracles. Nor do I know
if I would believe. Say that one saw the robbed
grave&mdash;what then? One travels not much further!
I would believe, I think, the hermit.”</p>

<p>“Then will you ride, Montjoy, to Damson
Wood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go there. But my believing and
yours and Gregory’s and the friars’ make not yet
the people’s believing. Here is stuff for splendid
quarrel with Hugh&mdash;but in the meantime go the
folk in rivers, touch the relics and are healed!”</p>

<p>“What we need,” said the Prior, and he spoke
slowly and cautiously, “is counter-miracle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you cannot order the Saints!”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>It was again the Prior who spoke and apparently
in agreement. The Abbot sighed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>“Well,
let us to bed!&mdash;Go to Damson Wood, Montjoy,
and then ride to Silver Cross.”</p>

<p>“I will do that. I see,” said Montjoy, “the
mischief that this thing does you&mdash;”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he had a vision of the Abbey
church of Silver Cross. He saw the tombs and
the sculptured figure of Isabel whom he had loved,
and the great altar painting of Our Lady done in
Italy. Under the breath of his mind he thought
that that form and face were like Isabel’s. So like
that almost she might have been in that Italian
painter’s mind when he painted this glorified
woman standing buoyant, in carnation and sapphire,
among clouds that thinned into clear blue
that passed in its turn into light that blinded. He
saw the glowing glass in the great windows; he
saw the gems&mdash;the gems that he had given
among them&mdash;sparkling in the golden box that
held the silver cross. He saw the people on holy
days flooding the famous church. They warmed
with eyes of life the stone mother and father, the
stone Isabel. The many people’s bended knees,
their recognition, helped to assure eternal life in
the Queen of Heaven pictured in the great painting,&mdash;and
surely so in Isabel, the picture was so
like her! The more people the more life&mdash;Isabel
surely safely there in the eternal Bride and
Mother&mdash;and if Isabel then surely he, too, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>lover and husband, he, too, Montjoy! The
people must flow there still, recognising life when
they saw it and as it were, giving life, increasing
life.</p>

<p>Anything that turned the people away from
Silver Cross became in that act the enemy of
Montjoy; anything that kept them flowing there,
that made them more in number, the friend of
Montjoy.</p>

<p>But Abbot and Prior, lodged in connecting
chambers and speaking together before they laid
themselves to sleep in huge beds, shook their
heads over him. Or rather the Abbot did so.
The Prior was not liberal with sighs and gestures.
“He’ll agree to no shift that smacks of the
lie, however slight, necessary, simply defensive,
pious it be&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? I am not,” answered Matthew.
“But if he will not&mdash;keep him blind like
other men, blind and usable! He may indeed
prove more usable for being blind.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> same night the monk, Richard Englefield,
lay upon his pallet in his cell at Silver Cross.
The moon shone in at the small window. He was
addressed to observing with his mind’s eye a
round of other places upon which she shone. The
grange where he had been born and had spent
childhood and somewhat of boyhood, rose softly.
The mill water caught light, the gable end of the
house stood, a figure like a silver shield enlarged,&mdash;shield
of Arthur, shield of Tristram, shield of
an old enchanter! The fields spread in moonlight
where he worked. He smelled the upturned
clods and the springing corn, and he smelled the
sere fields under October moon. The moon shone
on the town, that was not Middle Forest, where
he had been apprenticed to a worker in gold. The
moon made the roofs that mounted with their
windows, and the plastered house with the criss-cross
of timbers, into a rood screen for a giant’s
church. Beyond lay the sea, and the moon made
for herself a path across that.</p>

<p>Stella Maris&mdash;</p>

<p>The sea under moon. He had been across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>sea, to France and to Italy, but that was after the
rood-screen town. It was when he had become a
master workman, a skilled goldsmith, working for
princes, working as an artist works, and when he
had come to books&mdash;to books&mdash;to books.&mdash;The
moon on the sea, on the coasts of Italy!</p>

<p>The moon on the graves of kindred and friends,&mdash;the
cold moon. The moon above weariness
and sighing&mdash;nights unsleeping, walkings
abroad&mdash;plans spun and plans torn apart and
shredded to the winds. The moon upon sins, the
moon upon sorrows.</p>

<p>The moon shining down on the sea, on the
coasts of Italy!</p>

<p>The moon upon the hours after work, when he
read by the candle, when he put it out and looked
upon the night.&mdash;Moonlight streaming in at the
old room’s window, the window so high in the
high roof of the tall, old house.</p>

<p>Thought and thought and thought!&mdash;Conviction
that there was some adventure&mdash;</p>

<p>Warfare, warring and sinning, lusting. Pride
that beset him. Pride of being proud. Very love
of self-love. Very care of self-care. Self!</p>

<p>The moon on the coasts of Italy!</p>

<p>Men he had known, out of many men, and talk
with them. The old priest.</p>

<p>The moon on the coasts of Italy!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>The old priest.&mdash;Illness. Long illness when
death’s door had seemed to open. The priest still.
Recovery&mdash;and still the priest.</p>

<p>Wickedness again. Self-will and self-laudation.
Self! Longing, longing and discontent,
and ashes in the mouth. Longing and naught to
still it. Not work and not thought!</p>

<p>The priest again. Longing. One thing laid
down and another taken up and laid down. Hunger&mdash;hunger
and thirst&mdash;cold and hunger and
thirst. If you were in warm taverns, if you were
in palaces, yet cold and hunger and thirst. You
must hunt warmth, you must hunt bread, you
must hunt water. And when you thought you
had found came the snow in at the door, came the
harpies and snatched the tables away!</p>

<p>God&mdash;Christ and His Mother&mdash;heaven.
They had the food&mdash;the water that quenched
thirst,&mdash;the inner fire.</p>

<p>Where were you nearest, nearest?</p>

<p>Work fallen away because he must hunt.
Cronies and those whom he thought friends estranged.</p>

<p>Hunt and hunt and hunt. Dig inside, and outside
serve&mdash;</p>

<p>Where was the outer land that was nearest
inner?</p>

<p>God and Christ and His Mother and heaven.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>They dwelled in the inner that he was hunting.
Holy Church was the nearest land.</p>

<p>The moon on monastery fields&mdash;the moon on
the coasts of Italy!</p>

<p>The rising moon in the dark wood where he
walked and tried to talk to God and his soul&mdash;and
at last shut his hands and buried his forehead
upon them against an oak tree, and said, “I
become a monk.”</p>

<p>The moon on the garden of herbs, the moon on
Silver Cross cemetery.</p>

<p>He had been thirty then, and the dark wood was
six years ago.</p>

<p>At first had seemed quenching&mdash;but now was
cold, hunger and thirst again!</p>

<p>O God&mdash;O Christ&mdash;O Star of the Sea, shine
forth! Oh, heaven, appear!</p>

<p>The moon on the coasts of Italy!</p>

<p>They were fair, with rock and olive, with gray
and creamy and rose-hued towns, and over the
towns sky that was heart of blue, and in the towns
Italian life.</p>

<p>He must tell in confession how all that was
coming of late to haunt him. When he plunged
into these towns the hunger vanished for a time.
But it came again. And in his heart he knew that
he wished it to come. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>“O All-Knowledge and
All-Beauty, let me not cease to be driven and to
be drawn until I find thee&mdash;until I find thee!”</p>

<p>The bell rang for the office of the night. He
rose and presently stood chanting, with his
brother monks, in the church of Silver Cross. The
candles burned, the windows were lead against
the starry sky. He knew the stars that were behind
them, he saw them in their clusters.</p>

<p>The candles showed in part the great painting
of the Blessed among women. He could piece out
here also what they did not show. There was
splendour in the figure and face, a magic of
beauty, and he loved it.</p>

<p>The chanting filled the dark hollow of the
church.</p>

<p>The Abbot had dispensation from the night
office. The sub-prior was in his place. Moreover,
the Abbot was away, having ridden on his
white mule, with attendants, to Middle Forest, to
the castle of Montjoy.</p>

<p>The office ended, the cell again and sleep.
Dawn. Lauds. Breakfast. The reader for the
day reading from the life of a saint. “And an
angel came nightly to his cell and showed him the
scenery of heaven and the Blessed moving there.
And his brethren began to know of this, for the
light shined out of his cell.”</p>

<p>Brother Richard Englefield did not work in
field or garden. He had worked so for two years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Then Abbot Mark making discoveries, there had
been given him a stone room with a furnace, goldsmith’s
tools and two Brothers for helpers. If
you had a master maker among your monks waste
him not in digging, sowing, weeding and gathering!
Now he made lovely things for the church,
and for the Abbot’s table. He made presents for
the Abbot to send prelates and princes. The Abbot
bragged of his work. When great visitors
came they were shown him in his smithy.</p>

<p>Not only so, but because he was silent&mdash;brown-blond,
tall and still, like King David in the
picture&mdash;and evidently a hunter after God, and
scrupulous to do all the Rule demanded, and all
that it allowed of austerity supererogative&mdash;he
had fame as monk. Some of his brethren wished
him well and leaned upon his presence, taking as
it were his sunlight, valuing him in and for Silver
Cross. Two or three who also hunted God met
him and understood him. Others found in him a
reproach, and others were indifferent or secretly
laughed. Silver Cross was much like the world.
Brother Richard continued his struggle and his
hunting, under an exterior still as the church,
stripped and simple.</p>

<p>Work this day&mdash;work on a rich silver salt
cellar for the Abbot to give to a bishop. As he
worked in his stone room with his hammers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>gravers it was coming across him with a breath
of mockery&mdash;it was coming with a breath of
mockery like a wind from a foggy sea&mdash;“Above
and below the salt at a bishop’s table. Above and
below the salt&mdash;Christ’s table. Nicodemus above
the salt&mdash;blind Bartimeus and the woman of
Samaria below?”</p>

<p>He shook off phantasy. The Abbot was his
spiritual father whom he had undertaken to obey,
not criticise. True monk must obey and not question,&mdash;not
question, not doubt, not compare, not
judge. He must kill Imagination, wagging so.
Oh, Truth and Beauty&mdash;Truth and Beauty&mdash;Truth
and Beauty!</p>

<p>The sun on Gethsemane. The sun on the
Blessed among women sitting on her doorstep, behind
her the sound of the carpenters working.</p>

<p>Sext. The chanting, and the windows ruby and
emerald, sapphire and amethyst glass, the glowing
patterns, the rows of small figures. The dark
vault of the church and the shafts of gold dust.
The cool, the sense of suspension. The great picture
burning forth&mdash;the Blessed among women!</p>

<p>For long now the picture had taken his heart.
She was so glorious&mdash;she was so sure&mdash;she was
an ardent flame mounting with a golden passion
upward! And yet she was tender, compassionate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
None might doubt that, looking at her lips
and the light and shadow, the modelling, beneath
the eyes. She was so tall&mdash;did she turn her head,
so and so would be the exquisite long line of the
throat. Almost at times he thought she turned
her head. She was alive&mdash;splendidly so, with
glory. “Blessed among women&mdash;Blessed among
women&mdash;hold me more fully&mdash;take me with you
into heaven&mdash;take me&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Afternoon and work still. The sun going
down. Vespers. The Magnificat. The red-gold
light on the picture, uncertain, making her to
seem to move. So would she stand in the
round. “Blessed among women&mdash;Blessed among
women, I am here, thy child and lover! Make me
whole&mdash;take me with thee. Speak, speak to
me!”</p>

<p>Night. He did not sleep in the dormitory.
There were six cells of privilege, established when
Abbot Reginald of old had made certain alterations.
Brother Oswald who was writing the
Chronicle of Silver Cross, Brothers Peter and
Allen who illuminated the great Psalter, Brother
Timothy who had been longest monk of Silver
Cross and was growing like a child, Brother Norbert
who was the Abbot’s kinsman had the five,
and Brother Richard who made wealthy things in
gold and silver the sixth. So was not the Rule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>but in many things nowadays abbots modified
Rule.</p>

<p>Compline. Night in his cell. “Ah, if the noble
and rich visions were but more real! Ah, if I
had the power to move and make move! Ah, if
the picture would become Herself&mdash;for me, for
me!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Montjoy</span> rode through a dewy June morning.
He crossed the bridge, his horse’s hoofs sounding
deeply, an air from the sea filling nostrils, the
light striking sails of fishing boats gliding away
below the arches where all widened. Montjoy
was bound for Damson Wood.</p>

<p>Montjoy rode homeward in the evening, after
a day in the deep wood, after a visit to Damson
Hill graveyard. His two stout serving men, riding
the brown and the roan behind him, thought
it a strange visit.</p>

<p>Nearing the bridge Montjoy checked the black
horse and turning slightly, looked back at Saint
Leofric’s mound. There was now full, level flow
of reddened light, and the mound was bathed in it.
The church stood up in that light, the cloister
walls were made faery.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh and Hugh! I walk in your heart
and I see the dark engines, and I walk in your
mind and it is a hold for sorceries!”</p>

<p>He put his horse into motion. “Such a plan
and such a course could never have come to
Mark! Though it might have come to Prior
Matthew.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>He was upon the bridge. Others were crossing.
Sir Robert Somerville he caught up with.
“Well met, Somerville!”</p>

<p>“My lord Montjoy&mdash;” Somerville presented
his kinsman riding beside him. The sunset reddened
and reddened. The waters glowed below
the arches, the boats moved, a barge slipped underneath,
emerged and went up stream, its rowers
singing. The dark houses rose from the river
bank. One that was narrow and latticed, close to
the old wall, drew their eyes. The sunset made
its windows to blaze. Somerville and Montjoy
both saw, without the physical eye, the courtesan,
Morgen Fay.</p>

<p>Somerville began to talk of where he had been.
He had been to show his kinsman Saint Leofric’s
and a miracle.</p>

<p>Said Sir Humphrey, “I have always desired
to see a miracle.”</p>

<p>“Saw you one?”</p>

<p>“You gibe!” said Somerville. “But we did
see one. It would not be wise, even for Montjoy,
to doubt to the throng that we saw one!”</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“A woman received her sight.”</p>

<p>They left the bridge. The dying rose of the
sun touched Middle Forest’s High Street. Folk
were yet abroad, going this way and going that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
most or all going home. Droning sound was in
the air; then Saint Ethelred’s bell began to ring.</p>

<p>Somerville talked on. He lived so, with vivacity,
like a quick sword playing with joy in its
own point and edge, like wine liking its own
sparkle from beaker to cup. To a certain depth
he could read Montjoy. Old rivalries, jealousies
conflicts existed between Somerville and Montjoy.
Now all the sea above was calm, but those
ancient tendencies stayed like reefs below. Light-drawing
boats could pass above them, but greater
craft might be in danger.</p>

<p>Somerville’s quick and agreeable voice jetted
on. His eye, quick as a hawk’s, marked the small
erect man riding the black horse. If Montjoy in
his nature had sensitive tracts, far be it from
Somerville not to touch these! Do it always,
though with swordly skill, keeping one’s self invisible,
invulnerable!</p>

<p>Montjoy, it was evident, did not like Saint Leofric’s
miracles. Why? Somerville, using wit,
found part of it. All affairs were seesaw! You
go up; I go down. Up Saint Leofric; down Saint
Willebrod. Up Dominican; down Cistercian.
Up Prior Hugh; down Abbot Mark, Montjoy’s
kinsman. Up Friary; down Silver Cross, enriched
by, linked to, the castle on the hill. Up
neighbour’s glory; down my glory! If Montjoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
as apparently was the case, identified his glory
with that of Silver Cross&mdash;Why, or to what extent,
who cared? He did it, that was evident!
His doing it answered for Somerville’s cue.</p>

<p>Somerville with malice dilated upon the throng
at Saint Leofric’s and the mounting excitement.
He had a vigour and colour of speech that lifted
the scene bodily across the river and set it in the
High Street. He appealed for corroboration to
his cousin. The latter, though he could not guess
all, guessed some motive and fell easily in with
his kinsman and host. Not only the great play
over there, the singing and weeping, the light in
the church and the shout of joy&mdash;but he could
report the stir that was spreading through England.
Indeed, it was said that the Princess of
Spain was coming&mdash;</p>

<p>Montjoy thought, “That Princess should give
her presence to Silver Cross. She should smooth
Isabel’s tomb with her hand. Life should come
from her eyes to the picture.”</p>

<p>Somerville was drawing comparisons, and yet
he lived this side the river, up the Wander indeed,
where from any hilltop he might see Silver
Cross!</p>

<p>“It’s an ill bird that fouls its own nest!” said
Montjoy, harshly.</p>

<p>Somerville laughed and shot across a hawk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
glance. “But if it is true? Look at Abbot Mark
and then at Prior Hugh! The last ascetic, fired,
ever praying; the first&mdash;But he is your kinsman,
Montjoy, and I touch him not&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I want truth,” said Montjoy, and his voice
had an angry croak.</p>

<p>“Then in truth is he one whose abbey would
show miracles? Who says great sanctity shows
anywhere at Silver Cross? Is it carping to cry
out against sloth and indulgence? If they are
near home, I believe in confessing they are near
home! Has Silver Cross one monk who may
stand with the Friar to whom hand and arm
appeared?”</p>

<p>“I could tell you&mdash;,” burst forth Montjoy,
then checked himself. “I know not of the
monks,” he said, “though there be two or three&mdash;I
know not in these days of any place more or less
slothful than another. We are all drunken and
dazed, we have sinned so long! But of old Silver
Cross was a saintly place!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give you ‘of old’! Well, Saint Leofric
may redeem the time! And surely for that
we must rejoice!”</p>

<p>“If it be redeemer and not Iscariot&mdash;yes!
But Saint Leofric’s miracles are false miracles!”</p>

<p>He spoke with an energy of passion, forgetting
caution. He spoke louder than his wont. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
were passing through the market square and folk
in numbers were about. Montjoy’s voice reached
the nearer circle of these. There fell upon the
centre of Middle Forest a pause, a hush. It was
as though the world had come to an end! Then
like a bolt from the tawny sky laced with blue and
rose, fell a great voice, “You lie, lord of Montjoy!”</p>

<p>It was so thick, loud and startling that Montjoy
himself, thrilling, dragged his horse back upon
haunches. Somerville, too, started. It took a
moment to see that the voice proceeded from a
Black Friar, a man with the frame of a giant,
who had been climbing the stone stair to the upper
street. They were passing the stair foot; he
heard and turned. Now he was set as in a pulpit
above them. His great bell voice reached half
the dwindled market. The folk were already
looking Montjoy and Somerville way. Those
hearing Montjoy needed no explanation, but explained
to their fellows. Montjoy’s words ran
around the market place. With agitation a wave
of folk lifted itself and began to flow toward steps
and toward checked horses. The Black Friar’s
voice took thunder tone. “Who discredits Saint
Leofric discredits God and Our Lady and Her
Son!”</p>

<p>A woman shrilled from a booth of earthenware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and hats of plaited straw. “Don’t ye anger
the Saint and dry up his miracles, Montjoy!
Don’t ye! My dumb daughter is coming from up
the Wander. Don’t ye!”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye!”</p>

<p>“My palsied brother is going!”</p>

<p>“The morn I take my child&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye!”</p>

<p>A mob was gathering. Above their heads the
Dominican, great figure in great pulpit, with point
and energy recited as it were a rosary of Saint
Leofric’s deeds, and between them scarified
doubt. Said Somerville with an excited laugh,
“Wasp’s nest was not empty, Montjoy!”</p>

<p>Montjoy had power, Montjoy had his own kind
of popularity. He was thought a lord of his word
and of generous notions, rather a godly lord. He
had the gift of shy and subtle loving, and so he
loved Middle Forest and it hurt him always when
they differed.&mdash;Now what? He saw in a grim
flash of cold, uncaring light, that his world was
not going to have Saint Leofric’s miracles false.</p>

<p>No use saying anything&mdash;</p>

<p>He must even recover if he could its liking,
must render harmless to himself Black Friar’s
lightning.</p>

<p>What to say? How positively to lie? Excuse
stuck in his throat. At last he managed to shout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>forth. “You know me, good folk. If I doubt, it
is not Saint Leofric that I doubt!”</p>

<p>“Whom dost thou doubt? Prior Hugh, whose
austerities, whose prayers and fastings brought
the blessing? What dost thou doubt? That the
woman who this morn was blind now sees?”</p>

<p>“That you cannot doubt, Lord of Montjoy!”
said Somerville in a loud voice. “Sir Humphrey
Somerville and I saw that wonder! The woman
<em>sees</em>&mdash;praise Our Lady and Saint Leofric!”</p>

<p>Having cleared himself he found himself willing
to aid in extricating Montjoy. Give him the
prick of being aided! “The sun is strong to-day,
and my lord Montjoy hath been long in saddle
and is weary and half-sick! So for one instant,
good friends, the devil had his ear! It is naught&mdash;he
will shake the fiend off. Hurt him not by
mistrusting him! Presently will you see him on
pilgrimage himself to Saint Leofric’s!”</p>

<p>Montjoy, dry-voiced, tried to speak. He was
dark red, his voice broke in his throat. Suddenly,
sharply turning Black King, he touched him with
his heel and rode from the market place. “See
you, he is really a sick man!” cried Somerville
and pushed his bay after him. Sir Humphrey
followed, and Montjoy’s two serving men.</p>

<p>Middle Forest knew the lord of the castle for
an encreasingly devout man. It could not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>now see him as scoffer. Sir Robert Somerville,
now, was much more like a scoffer than was
Montjoy! For a moment folk hung in the wind,
then the larger number agreed to give Montjoy
the benefit of the doubt. Probably to-morrow he
would come praising Saint Leofric! Envious
Satan did attack each one in turn! The buzz and
hum continued, but it left the key of anger. The
Black Friar, having vindicated the right, climbed
triumphantly the stair to the upper street.</p>

<p>On castle road where the Wander road diverged
Montjoy abruptly said good night. His
voice was moved, sonorous, thrilling with hurt
pride. He seemed eager to leave them, to mount
to his old castle that was not so large, not so
threatening, after all!</p>

<p>When he was gone Somerville laughed, and Sir
Humphrey complaisantly with him. They trotted
on upon the Wander road, a great manor house
and supper before them, three miles up the vale.
“When all’s spoken,” said Somerville, “I have
a back-handed liking for that lord that’s just left
us! I like him enough inwardly to quarrel with
him, and frustrate him, and make sure that he
thinks not too well of himself! I preoccupy myself
with him. The day is stale when I run not
somehow against him! What miracle he decrys,
will I cry up; or what he cries up, will I decry!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>He began to whistle, sweet and clear as a blackbird.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> on a May but on a June morning&mdash;five
days in fact after his supper at the house of Morgen
Fay&mdash;Master Thomas Bettany found himself
some miles up the Wander, and with him, riding
the gray mare, a bale of sample cloths
strapped to saddle, John Cobb the apprentice, with
whom, when he did not think to be stiff, he was
upon the best of terms. He was up the Wander
upon business for his father, that rich merchant
who would one day leave him house and gear and
trade. Then would he himself, Thomas Bettany,
be Middle Forest merchant,&mdash;who wanted only
to sail for the New World that one Columbus had
recently discovered!</p>

<p>He rode absorbed in discontent. Finally he
again took up speech with John Cobb.</p>

<p>“It’s a dull life! I wish something would happen&mdash;anything!”</p>

<p>“There be the miracles.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any hand in them. You can’t be interested
unless you’re doing something yourself.&mdash;I’d
rather be a robber than just trotting from
shop and trotting back again.&mdash;Hist, John!
What’s behind yon tree?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“There! A big, black man! Two&mdash;four,
five! Draw your weapon, man!”</p>

<p>John struck hand to the dirk at his waist. His
eyes enlarged, his lips clapped shut. Then,
“They bain’t but little fir trees!&mdash;You’re grinning!&mdash;Your
pranking and mystery-playing’ll
break you one day!”</p>

<p>“I wish it had been Robin Hood&mdash;”</p>

<p>They rode through the wood. It was a bright
morn after rain. The trees showered them with
diamonds, the world smelled like a pomander box.
When they were out from the trees and amid
tilled land every blade of springing grain carried
jewels. Far up in a light blue sky a lark was singing.</p>

<p>“By’re lady!” said John Cobb. “If I were
taken up by Somerville and went to sup with Morgen
Fay, I’d not be saying life was dull!”</p>

<p>“He nor no one else has ‘taken me up.’ His
uncle married my father’s cousin. Bettany’s a
name that has sounded well since long time. My
father helped him, too, with monies&mdash;but that’s
nothing either!&mdash;Somerville and I are friends.”</p>

<p>“Like you and me?”</p>

<p>“No!&mdash;His being ‘Sir Robert’ and older
doesn’t make any difference.”</p>

<p>He was superbly sure of that and rode with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>blond head up like a youthful, adventurous
king. “As for Morgen Fay, I’d think more of
her if I hadn’t seen last Candlemas&mdash;you know
whom!”</p>

<p>“That’s Mistress Cecily. She’s a fair one!
But I don’t believe she’s pricked your heart much
either. You’re just for the New World and men
and adventure. It would make me proud though
to sup with Morgen Fay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll never, my poor John! I tell you
what she’s like. She’s like something you see in
poetry. But Cecily walked in first, into my keep
and hold. Besides, I wouldn’t interfere with
Robert.”</p>

<p>“Robert!” John Cobb could but admire,
while Master Thomas Bettany tossed his clear
whistle up to the lark singing.</p>

<p>So many birds were singing! The two were
now riding by the Wander, through Westforest
land. Mounting a little hill they saw below them
monastery walls and roofs, not a large place, set
among trees by the water’s side. Some of the old
forest held here.</p>

<p>Their business was with Westforest. The
house of Bettany sold Silver Cross and Westforest
woollen cloth for monks’ gowns. Presently
they were at the gate. The porter opened to
them, and the stable Brother took their horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>and a third Brother carried them to the guest
house where they were set in a room. All was
very grave and in order. Master Thomas Bettany
at the window heard bells and saw the monks
pacing two by two. He had never before been to
Westforest. Saint Ethelred in Middle Forest
was his church. Neither with any sufficiency did
he know Silver Cross. He had been five times
perhaps, when there was festival, in the great
church. Only this year was his father using him
thus in business.</p>

<p>The monk reappeared and had them to the refectory
where they were served with ale and
bread and cheese. Thence they went to a business-like
room where met them Brother Oswald, steward
and purchaser for the Priory. He gave Master
Thomas Bettany good greeting, and John
Cobb a shorter one. John Cobb opened the bale
of cloths.</p>

<p>Business advanced. A Brother appeared to do
duty as steward’s clerk. Thomas Bettany turned
into merchant not unshrewd. He did things with
his might, when he could be brought to do them
at all. Now he pictured and bargained and was
not behind Brother Oswald in ability.</p>

<p>The hour and more of marketing passed.
Brother Oswald, straightening himself from the
table at last, paid his compliment. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>“No manner
of doubt, my son, but that you be merchant, son
of merchant!”</p>

<p>“If Westforest be not content&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, we are content.”</p>

<p>“&mdash;and I have here,” said the younger Bettany,
“the fine white wool&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is for reverend father the Prior to see.
Let your man take it up and we will go to the parlour.”</p>

<p>They crossed the cloister to a large, well-windowed
room that gave upon walled garden. On
a bench without sat a monk with book and rosary,
and he would get audience for them with reverend
father. Presently the inner door opened and
Prior Matthew stood before them. Thomas Bettany
and John Cobb kneeled for his blessing, and
when that was had John Cobb spread the table
with lengths of fine white cloth. The Prior chose,
nor was long about it. The Abbot of Silver Cross
loved finery, dressing much like a lord of this
world. But Prior Matthew scorned all that and
kept near in apparel to ancient simplicities.</p>

<p>Selection made, orders given and taken, the
Prior leaned back in his seat. His deep-set eyes
surveyed the younger Bettany. “I know your
father for a sensible man. I have heard that you
are a wild youth, a will-o’-the-wisp, ready for God
knoweth what plots and pranks!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>If Thomas inwardly recognised large portion
of himself he could outwardly but lift deprecating,
bright blue eyes. “I am changing what I can
change, reverend father.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Let us hope it,” said the Prior. “Well,
and what makes most ado just now in Middle
Forest?”</p>

<p>“Reverend father, the miracles across the
river.”</p>

<p>Prior Matthew bit his nail. “That is as I supposed.
It mounts and mounts.&mdash;I would get
from you, too, the cry after that burst of wonders!&mdash;But
there is the vesper bell. Go into
church, my son! afterwards I will talk with you
in the garden.”</p>

<p>The church at Westforest was not like the
church of Silver Cross. That was great, this
was small. That had starry windows of rich
glass, that had tombs of lords and ladies, that had
the great altar picture. This was plain and cold of
aspect. Yet was there an altar painting, and now
sunlight and candle light showed it for what it
was,&mdash;copy, done half as large, of the Silver
Cross great picture. The Lady of Heaven lifted
a rich Italian face, rose toward heaven, toward
God the Father and God the Son, with a rich,
Italian beauty, nobly done by the great Italian, her
painter,&mdash;rose with love and majesty, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>memory of sorrow and of earth-stain falling
away, fading, falling, with height of joy opening;
rose with bliss and power, who yet understood,
who knew children’s crying and would answer;
rose from world’s woe, from the dust, to heaven.
She was heaven, the Rose of Heaven. Yet had
she been painted in Italy from mortal woman.
Queen of Heaven, but with framework of likeness
to earthly faces. “Like Isabel&mdash;like
Isabel!” at this moment Montjoy cried to himself,
in the church of Silver Cross.</p>

<p>In the small grey church at Westforest young
Thomas Bettany had place where he might well
and plainly view the smaller picture, but well
copied from the first and greater. Light beat
against draperies pure red and pure blue and upon
form and face, rising from darkness into glory.
He looked worshipfully, and he felt worship.</p>

<p>But when vespers were done, and the Prior
kept him alone with him walking in the garden,
John Cobb not here, only Prior Matthew and
Thomas Bettany pacing between the blue flags
and the rose trees, he burst out suddenly, very
young and very bold. “Reverend father, did
ever you see Morgen Fay?”</p>

<p>“God forbid! No!”</p>

<p>“She is much like yonder picture.”</p>

<p>“What picture?&mdash;Not the altar picture!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>“Of course this is holy and heavenly&mdash;and
she is only faery&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Faery!’&mdash;She is an accursed woman!”</p>

<p>The Prior stood still, his hand upon the espaliered
pear tree against the south wall. His thin
face, his tall thin figure grew extraordinarily
alive. “Do you never tell that fancy!” His
voice had a fearful sternness. “Do you never tell
that fancy to any living wight!”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany himself was afraid of it.
“Jesu knows I would not do Our Lady disrespect!”</p>

<p>“It will be heinous disrespect if you say that
that sinner hath her face&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bettany carefully made distinctions. “I meant
not like Her&mdash;but like the woman the painter
must have used just for hint of form and face!
Once I saw a monk painting on a missal border
where it said ‘Rose of Sharon.’ But he had in
a cup beside him which he looked often upon a
rose from the garden.”</p>

<p>“Well, speak not of such things!” said the
Prior impatiently. “The generality understands
them not. They think not that things are but
lifted or lowered, set in light or in darkness. You
but hurt yourself!”</p>

<p>“That is true enough!” thought the merchant’s son.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>They paced the walk to a stone bench set before
fruit trees whose shadow was now long upon the
grass. The Prior, head sunk in cowl, was thinking.
He sat down, the young man standing before
him. “The miracles&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bettany set sail upon that story. Last week a
woman had received her sight. Three days ago
a man for years bedridden had walked. Yesterday
had come a shipmaster carrying his daughter
in his arms. “Praise! Praise!” shouted the
people. It was like a Great Fair for numbers,
at Saint Leofric’s! At times bridge was thick
with folk.</p>

<p>And then midway in his recital to which he was
warming, which he was now colouring rightly,
Prior Matthew, with a sudden start and jerk, returned
to the picture and had from him promise
not to let pass his lips to any other that sinful
fancy.</p>

<p>He promised, seeing himself that facts were
not always for shouting.</p>

<p>Morgen Fay who was merchant and sold herself,
who had great beauty and dark eyes, and
who wore those reds and blues, might be picked&mdash;or
one like her might be picked&mdash;a common
rose out of common garden, and a painter might
take her for line and feature and hue and sublimate
all&mdash;and yet the <i>Rosa Mystica</i>, the God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Bride and Mother, be never hurt, be never the
worse for that, where she looked from high
heaven, pitying all and helping who would be
helped,&mdash;pitying, perchance, Morgen Fay!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="6">VI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">June</span> vanished, July rode in heat, August had
golden armour, September was russet clad and
walked through crimson orchards and by wine
presses. In Italy, by wine presses!</p>

<p>In the Abbey of Silver Cross more and more
did note fall upon Englefield. He was unaware
of that. He had entered upon a stretch of the
inward way where the landscape was absorbing,&mdash;the
inner landscape and the inner encounters.
Outwardly he grew more and more conformed to
the Abbey idea of fledgling saint, but he hardly
held it in consciousness that he did so. He was
rapt to the inner land where he hunted the Word,
where he sought for the Grail. But he put his
body in the attitudes that the great adventurers,
where they were monks, seemed to have worn.
He wished their assurances and blisses, and he
imitated.</p>

<p>Not having come to monastery from indolence
and softness, he found in this no especial difficulty.
First artisan, then artist, he well enough knew
hard and spare living, vigil, concentered action,
swift, deep and still. He had that over many
an one who would be saint, but must first develop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>muscle. He had will, he had mind, though both
were restive beings, with wings that seemed between
Lucifer’s and Gabriel’s. Richard Englefield’s
problem was to draw all the Lucifer into
Gabriel. As a detail in the achievement he conformed,
with what absoluteness was possible at
Silver Cross, to the first hard discipline of the
Order. Where for long had been relaxation, his
procedure here astonished and here rebuked,
pleased and displeased. He went on, in a preoccupation
too great to note that watching, hunting
the Word. “Blessed among women, help me
toward it!”</p>

<p>The great picture was become integral to his
life. “Beauty like that&mdash;Beauty with Holiness&mdash;I
would Beauty and I would Holiness! I
would Power to make my Beauty and Holiness
come true!”</p>

<p>He prayed to the Blessed among women.
“Blessed among women, show me how! Bring
me sunshine for my growth!”</p>

<p>He worked in his stone room, with the precious
metals that they gave him. The furnace glowed.
His long, strong and skilful fingers moved with
their old skill, as on a lute. But he worked scarce
seeing the beauty of what he made, with the
taller man in him gone elsewhere, gone out hunting,
gone hawking for pure Wisdom, pure Beauty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>pure Power. He prayed in the church and the
monks watched him. When he turned toward
the picture light seemed to pass from it to him.</p>

<p>The Abbot noted him. The sub-prior brought
the Abbot refectory talk, talk of the brethren’s
common room. He brought comment of Brother
Norbert whose cell was next Brother Richard’s.
The Abbot heaved a sigh. “Well, we have need
of a saintly monk!”</p>

<p>He was not silent upon the growing saintliness
of Brother Richard. Visitors of high degree,
pausing at Silver Cross, heard him say, “Even as
Friar Paul of Saint Leofric’s&mdash;”Visitors pursuing
their road, going, it might well chance,
straight to Saint Leofric’s, made mention of this
monk. The vale of Wander spoke of him. The
Prior of Westforest said in chapter house, “Had
we one brother like Brother Richard of Silver
Cross&mdash;” Not only to his monks, but he said it to
the country around, “Brother Richard of Silver
Cross&mdash;”</p>

<p>Montjoy said “Brother Richard of Silver
Cross,” but he said it very differently from the
Abbot and the Prior. He said with a kind of
passionate reverence and hope. He wished there
to be true saints; he wished there to arise one out
of Silver Cross. He wished a saint, a saint kneeling
beside Isabel, kneeling with Isabel beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>the great picture, whose form, whose face in
which God was dawning, was like Isabel. Isabel
like Her, though maybe in that degree from Her&mdash;that
was Morgen Fay from Isabel whom
surely, too, she resembled.</p>

<p>Middle Forest had rumour of the monk at Silver
Cross.</p>

<p>Prior Hugh spoke of him at Saint Leofric’s
but he spoke in scorn and drew plans for greater
and greater guest houses.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Somerville, having need to see Silver
Cross as to a bit of debatable ground touching
Abbey fields and manor wood, rode into Abbey
close upon a misty, pearly day. He had his talk
in the Abbot’s most comfortable parlour, sub-prior
at hand to aid memory. The land certainly
leaned to the Abbey side of the wall, or had been
brought skilfully to lean by Abbey lawyers.
Somerville saw that it were wisest to leave it debatable,
awaiting some more fortunate aspect
of manor stars. He slid from the subject, but
with a sparkle in his eye. That glint always came
when he ticketed a grudge and put it somewhere
for safe keeping until it could be paid.</p>

<p>And as he thought it would be unpleasing to the
Abbot, he began presently to talk of Saint
Leofric’s, to whom by now great fame had
cleaved, by whose wall was building a town&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>“Friar Paul&mdash;his visions&mdash;!” exclaimed the
Abbot and broke off. There was no good, as
Montjoy had proved, in casting pebble or boulder
of discredit. The people were besotted, joined
to their idol, this very Dagon that Hugh had set
up! If Contrariousness were not already in possession
then the hermit Gregory’s death in July
had set her high on throne! The Abbot covered
his eyes with his hand, then said, “There is a
monk here that I hold to be holy as any living Dominican!”</p>

<p>“Hath he vision?”</p>

<p>“Yea,” said the Abbot, then in his heart. “He
must have!”</p>

<p>“It is not sufficient!” said Somerville. “Nothing
now but revelations and healings following
will even Silver Cross! Greater revelations,
greater healings than Saint Leofric. You can’t
go down the stair in such things. You must go
up.”</p>

<p>He spoke with fine malice. Abbot Mark
glanced at him and said smoothly, “Very true, my
son! but Heaven does not ask our will nor way
in such matters! If it smiles, it smiles. Nor can
it be limited to one handful. It may be that in this
England we have touched a harvest week, as it
were, and that many a sheaf will be thrown
down.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>He rose. “Come! I will show you Brother
Richard.”</p>

<p>He whom they sought was standing at the table
in the room where he worked. Between his hands
was a bowl of silver whereon he had wrought
vine leaves and grapes. He put down his work
and kneeled before the Abbot, then stood with
crossed hands and lowered eyes. He was brown-blond,
tall and still, with a face of dimmed power,
dimmed beauty.</p>

<p>When they had gone away, said Somerville,
“Lord Abbot, Friar Paul is twice as thin and
pale as yonder monk, and hath eyes that burn like
coals! He would never see within him nor bring
forth, vine leaves around a silver bowl! He sees
but saints and martyrs filling his cell and speaking
to him out of glories!” He nodded as he
finished.</p>

<p>The staccato of his voice drummed like a rude
heel upon the Abbot’s now fevered desire. Said
the Abbot’s will, deep down, “He shall see all
that is necessary. Oh, Hugh. I will oust you
yet!”</p>

<p>Somerville rode away. Halfway to his house,
up the Wander, his mind perceived something
that made him laugh. “I am not prophet, yet
will I prophesy! Before spring there will be
miracles at Silver Cross!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a foggy day, a grey pearl, with shadows
that were trees.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Aha and Aho!</div>
    <div class="p_line">Mankind and its woe,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Children at their playing,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Straying, straying!</div>
    <div class="p_line">Little marsh fire</div>
    <div class="p_line">That the sun is,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Thou art a liar,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Little marsh fire!”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Somerville often made poems as he rode. Now
he made this one.</p>

<p>The next day was foggy still, and the Abbot was
not wont to ride abroad in fog. Yet he called for
his white mule and for two Brothers to attend
him, and rode, booted and wrapped warm, to
Westforest.</p>

<p>There may be imagined a chessboard, and Prior
Matthew, with Abbot Mark for backer, sitting
studying, mouth covered by hand. He must
play against Prior Hugh, invisible there, or perhaps
against mere cosmic insensibility to advantages
accruing from full streams of profit and
glory, fuller than the Wander, flowing down
Wander vale. Chess takes time and thought. If
there come inspirational gleams take them as
evidence that Nature begins to lean with you&mdash;but
continue your study, mentally advancing now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>this piece and now that, going slow, going sure,
making your combinations with more than grey
spider’s skill! So Prior Matthew played. Abbot
Mark was more impatient and would have things
without working for them, which is to say without
deserving them. In the mysterious cave of this
world where all players must play, failure always
impended. If it did not fall, that was because you
were a good player. The Prior’s hollow cheek
grew more hollow, his intent, small, deep-set eyes
more intent.</p>

<p>On this day, folded as in wool, in the parlour
that was warmed by blazing logs on stone hearth,
that gave upon the autumn garden, much to-day
like a ghost-garden, Prior indicated to Abbot
move and then move and then move again.</p>

<p>“God pardon us!” breathed the Abbot.
“That’s a bold thing!”</p>

<p>“Bolder than Hugh? I think not so. Or if it
is we need to be bolder than he. Boldness hurts
not, but the lack of skill in boldness. Attain the
miracles, and Silver Cross arises re-gilt. Streams
of pilgrims&mdash;nay, you may tap and dry up <em>his</em>
stream of pilgrims! Abbey built and magnified
for ages. Attain them not, and all is vain, for
our lifetime at least! We may go sleep, fogged
and obscured forever, in the vale of Wander!
Both houses and in us the Order.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>“I know that we need to be bolder than Hugh.”</p>

<p>“We need more living colour to draw, and a
louder drum.”</p>

<p>The Abbot took for his own, saying of Somerville’s,
“You cannot go down the stair in such
things. You must go up the stair. There’s too
much risk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenteous! So had Hugh risk. But
when the fish had once bitten no mortal man could
get hook from its mouth!”</p>

<p>“Meaning by the fish the people? Yes. But
if Hugh and me and you, Matthew, be all three
taken in mortal sin?”</p>

<p>“Has he hurt Saint Leofric? Or Saint
Dominic his Order? Or the folk whose bodies
are healed? Does not glory go up to heaven like
incense?”</p>

<p>“It is true. If it be venial sin, then Our Lady,
an altar of pure silver to thee!”</p>

<p>“That will be well! It will still more beautify
the church. But cease,” said Matthew, “to have
this monk work at thy gold and silver! It goes
not with kneeling and fasting all day and vigil at
night, with great and sole visions and voices, and
favour from the Saints!”</p>

<p>“Very good. I will put him to his book and
solitude.”</p>

<p>The Prior took quill and drew upon a leaf of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>paper a plot of cells and passageways. “You
will empty these five cells.”</p>

<p>“Aye. They shall go back to dormitory.”</p>

<p>“Door is to be here and door there. To get it
done, while masons are upon it&mdash;and for other
reasons as well&mdash;give your monk penance for
some fault, sending him out of Silver Cross to
Westforest. Let me have him for a month, no
less.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with him?”</p>

<p>“I will indoctrinate him with expectancy.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Mark doubtfully, “he
is one that might one day become true saint.”</p>

<p>“Think you so? Well, I wish him innocent
and believing&mdash;even as I hold Friar Paul across
river may be innocent and believing!”</p>

<p>“‘Innocent!’” The Abbot groaned. “But
you and I and Hugh will not be innocent!”</p>

<p>“No. We shall be wise and bold for the glory
of our heritage. Choose&mdash;and choose now&mdash;which
you will have!”</p>

<p>The Abbot chose. The chess game went on.
Outside the day folded in, fold on fold of white
wool and grey wool, fog coming up from the sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fog wrapped the river. The bridge
showed now a few arches and now none. Boats
were moths in a moth dimness and silence. Saint
Leofric’s mount across the water could not be
seen. The walls of the houses on this side stood
chill and grey, or faded away into a dream. The
garden below barely lived, a wistful, faded place,
no colour even to dream of colour.</p>

<p>Morgen Fay hated the day. “Miserable! I
want to go live in the sun!”</p>

<p>“Will you have your book? Will you have
your tapestry frame?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>The large woman, Ailsa, shrugged and went
to Tony in the warm kitchen. They talked there.
“Now she is nightingale or moon in the sky&mdash;and
now she is lion-woman or panther-woman&mdash;and
now she is just a slut that I could whip&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Up in the oak room Morgen Fay lay face down
among the cushions of the long window seat.
Ennui was in the room like the fog. It was in her
veins, her mouth. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>“I am set face to a dead wall,
and I shall be here forever! Unless the wall is
broken and my feet are let to move, I will say
that life is a naught, a nothing-wall restraining
nothing from nothing, a dead grin on a dead
face!”</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!” ran through
her head and sat in her heart. “Nothing&mdash;grey
nothing&mdash;black nothing. I am come to that. I
stick in that. I go not up nor down, nor to nor
fro. Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing! Nothing
that yet is wretched, being nothing!”</p>

<p>She lay with dark eyes hidden in bend of arm.
“Oh, something&mdash;something&mdash;something come
to me!”</p>

<p>She lay in the grey room in the world of grey
fog. A pebble wrapped in a glove, thrown from
without, struck the glass of the window above her.
She knew that kind of sound, that kind of knock.
“Ho, you within!” At first she meant not to
look, not to answer. It was all grey nothing&mdash;no
sun out there to lift the cloud. Habit, old, dull
and very strong, at last haled her from her pillows
and set her face against the pane. She could
not see. She pressed the catch that opened the
small square in the larger square. Now the fog
poured in, and the sound of the river. She made
out the small boat below, one man standing in it.</p>

<p>He saw her face come out of the mist. Blue
eyes looked into black eyes. “Ah, so doleful is it
in this fog!” cried young Thomas Bettany.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>“Aye, and aye again. I yawn with death up
here!”</p>

<p>“So grey it is none will see and steal my boat
fastened here. Foot here and foot there, and so
I could climb&mdash;were the window opened more
wide!”</p>

<p>She opened it. He did as he had pictured and
entered the oak room. “I have been,” she said,
“in two minds whether to hang myself or drown
myself. I want no kisses. I like you because you
have blue speedwell eyes and are truly gay. If
you can sit and talk and make me who sit inside
gay, do it! If you cannot&mdash;back to the river!”</p>

<p>“Your blue and red warm the grey cloud. Are
you melancholy? Sometimes I am so until I
would give the world a buffet and depart.”</p>

<p>“You are nineteen and a young king and know
naught about it!” said Morgen Fay. She took
her seat by the small fire on the hearth and he sat
opposite. He had no amorous passion for her
and she knew it. Once she would have set herself
to making him find it. Now she did not care.
She had not cared once this year. She felt no
amorous movement toward him, but she liked
him. She was thirty-two. Now, sitting there,
she could have said “Son&mdash;”</p>

<p>He nursed his knee, looking now at the blue
and red flames and now at Morgen Fay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>“To get back a gay heart why not go to Saint
Leofric’s?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in miracles. If they are, they
are for others, not for me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you believe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I know a deal of Morgen Fay
and there’s a deal I do not know. But neither
what I know nor what I do not know creeps and
prays to a dead man’s bones. All that to me is a
mockery! I laugh at it and against it. Some
are healed? Doubtless! Many! But believed
they so of it, a rose in my garden, so they smelled
it, kissed it, believed it was rooted in Paradise,
would heal them! They heal themselves. Believing!
Believing! I would that I had it. So
easy to cure one’s self! Oh, the self is the wonder
that is so dark and is so bright, so strong and so
feeble!”</p>

<p>She looked at him sombrely, hunger in her face.</p>

<p>“If you said all that outside&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, indeed, if I said it! Morgen Fay that
has ’scaped sheet and candle all these years might
have them now, but for a different reason! I’ll
not say it outside&mdash;nor inside on a different day.
To-day I would tell the truth, for there is no
sparkle in lying!”</p>

<p>She brooded over the fire. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>“What is the truth?
Now I believe what I have said&mdash;and to-morrow
I might go swimming toward a miracle! I have
swam so in the past&mdash;believed with the shoal
there was food there. But no! It shall not be
again toward dead-white bone!”</p>

<p>He began, blue-eyed, young and keen, to talk
of travel that he wanted so badly! He was talking
as youth might talk to motherhood, who
always listened. Cathay and Ind by the western
way! They hung over the fire, the fog came
about the house; they were far, far, far away!</p>

<p>When it was growing dusk, before Ailsa
brought the candles, he went through the window
and down as he had come to his boat,&mdash;and so
off like a moth.</p>

<p>If he had not left Morgen Fay gay of heart, yet
listening and speaking, and never a caress between,
liking this boy and travelling a bit with
him, her mood was less ashen, or began to glow
amid its ashes. She bent herself over the fire,
she put her locked hands over her forehead, she
rocked herself; desire and mind went wandering
together. “Forest&mdash;forest deep and still. Landless
sea, salt and clean. Solitude, solitude&mdash;and
out of it the Miracle rising&mdash;and Morgen Fay
dead at its feet&mdash;but I safe forever, healed forever!
But it will not come, my Miracle, it will not
come, it will not come!”</p>

<p>The dark increased. Ailsa brought the candles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>The next eve brought Somerville,&mdash;alone, in
mood of return but not otherwise in good mood.
A man of many levels, something had crossed him
and he perched to-day upon one of the lower levels
of himself. Morgen Fay’s mood to-night was
soulless, hard and reckless. She was not nightingale,
nor moon in the sky, nor lion-woman nor
panther-woman; she was nearer the slut that
Ailsa would have under her fingers. She drank
much wine with Somerville.</p>

<p>When he was at this ebb and scurf of himself
he liked so to loosen her tongue, for she could
then flay for him&mdash;skilfully as ever Apollo flayed
Marsyas&mdash;that breadth of living, that cluster
of folk or that individual that he chose to lead to
her. Perhaps she knew them, or perhaps she took
them and their acts from his lips. Either way,
with a vigour of disdain, a vigour of hate, of
anger against an universe that was increasingly
giving her now ennui and now whips of scorpions,
she drew from them and held aloft a skin of attributes
and motives that made dreadful laughter
for the onlookers. She and Somerville were the
onlookers.</p>

<p>In these moods he was her demon and she was
his. They sat cheek by jowl, in the lowest strata
of themselves, drinking each the worst of the
other, poisoning and poisoned. When they came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>to embraces, to a pitiful, animal revivification&mdash;thinking
so to get light and solace&mdash;that was the
lesser harm.</p>

<p>Somerville brought into their talk Brother
Richard Englefield. “There is a monk at Silver
Cross. Watch for appearances and miracles
there also!”</p>

<p>“What can church say to us? Where’s honesty?
Here, Rob, here!”</p>

<p>“He is a tall, brown-gold man that was a goldsmith
once. He can still make you lovely things
in silver and gold.”</p>

<p>“So he becomes cheating alchemist and all his
gold is lead and brass!”</p>

<p>“Much like thine own!” said a loud voice
within Morgen Fay. She struck at it, would not
have it, poured to-night, being to-night a slut,
muck and mire upon it.</p>

<p>“Let him cheat&mdash;and Silver Cross cheat, and
Saint Leofric’s, and Prior Hugh and Abbot
Mark! I would have them cheat, bringing their
inward outward! It is there. Let the horn blow
for the toad to come forth!”</p>

<p>“I wish to see,” said Somerville, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>“the play
they make! It will be players and masquers
worth the fee! There will be Saint Willebrod,
or who else they can impress, and Brother Richard,
and a new Somewhat or That Which that
works miracles&mdash;or an old That Which working
with youth come again!”</p>

<p>“We are fallen on evil times! No miracles
save those we work ourselves! And we are so
clumsy!”</p>

<p>“Abbot Mark may be clumsy. I hold that the
Prior of Westforest will marshal the play.”</p>

<p>“And they are more safe than coiners in some
forest cavern!”</p>

<p>“That, sweetheart, is because we are so hungry
for miracles. See how we beg Saint Leofric for
more! We are so lantern-jawed that we will take
marsh grain, so it be baked in a loaf!”</p>

<p>She laughed. “All gaunt with hunger&mdash;getting
wolf-toothed. I, too, have whined and will
whine again, for a miracle!”</p>

<p>He poured her more wine. “It’s a wicked old
world! The only way is to grin and shove it
along.”</p>

<p>“Unless you stop it with a rope. If I were
sure I <em>could</em> stop it.”</p>

<p>“Drink your wine. Here’s to Brother Richard&mdash;dog-monk
noseing out the unearthly!”</p>

<p>She drank. “Here’s to Prior Matthew the
marshal! If it’s to be a good play, I would be a
playgoer!”</p>

<p>“Here’s to the rotten time&mdash;the hungry people!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>“Here’s to the rotten time&mdash;the hungry people.”
She drank, then set slowly down the cup
and put her crossed arms upon the table and
bowed her head upon them. She and Somerville
were down, down, far down in themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Englefield</span> listened to the Abbot’s
assertion that making of inner vessels of gold for
heaven’s use was of more import than were dishes
for abbot’s table and for gifts. He agreed, but
his mind said, “Since when did you find that
out?”</p>

<p>Moreover, he would miss his work. He
missed it.</p>

<p>When he came to confession he met another
change,&mdash;namely, severity in penance. Heretofore
he had been the severe one with himself.
Now his spiritual fathers took it over. “Why?”
asked his mind, but his hunger for holiness and
his will harnessed to that hunger rebuked his
mind. “Have we not agreed that they are our
masters in heavenly law? Then learn the lessons
they give! Cease to cavil and question!
Did you so with Godfrey the Master Smith?”</p>

<p>He accepted penance, watched, fasted, scourged
himself. He grew very thin, less strong of frame
than he had been. Sleeplessness, even when he
was given or gave himself leave to sleep, fastened
itself upon him. It was as though his soul ceaselessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
walked a dungeon. “O God, where is thy
heaven? If I might see it or feel it!”</p>

<p>The great picture in the church lost its mystery
and enchantment and power. It was a dead canvas
to him. “O my soul, come thou forth!”</p>

<p>He was kept solitary in his cell. Solitude did
not appal him, seeing that he had ever been artist,
able to people it. But one day when a strong sunbeam
came through the window his mind said
loudly, and as it were it shook him by the shoulders.
“Why this straitness with thee? What
are they about?”</p>

<p>But he was afraid to listen,&mdash;Richard Englefield,
fearing for his soul. Fear, casting about
for aid, found Vanity in a small hidden chamber,
sitting there with closed lids, somewhat faint and
unnourished. He brought her forth and sent her
up, strengthening as she came. “It is seen that I
begin to light this monastery! They would trim
the lamp.”</p>

<p>Fear, Vanity, Pride and Old Credulity!</p>

<p>At Martinmas the Abbot sent him to Westforest.
It was heavy penance for monk to go to
Westforest that was small, hard and bare beside
Silver Cross, that had rude living, that owned a
Prior could give tasks, set one to heavy and distasteful
work. Brother Richard Englefield was
not put to handwork, but again to watching, fasting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
cries to all the Saints, to Jesu and Mary
Mother and God the Father.</p>

<p>He fell ill at Westforest. He was not laid in
hospital but left in the Westforest penitential cell,
though they spread a pallet for him where had
been bare stone. Prior Matthew visited him here.
He came in the day, and he came, taper in hand,
by night. He had a medicine which he gave
Brother Richard. He himself dropped a few
dark drops into a cup of water or of milk and held
it to the monk’s lips. “Drink!” After the first
time Richard Englefield tried to put it away. “On
your obedience!” said the Prior sternly. The
monk drank.</p>

<p>He began to recover from the illness that had
prostrated him. But something seemed to have
gone from his life and something seemed to have
come into it. One night in this cell he heard a
voice. “Richard! Richard!” it cried. He
could not tell whence it came; it seemed above
him. He sat up. “Who speaks?” But when it
said “Willebrod, who was martyred,” he stared
incredulous. Sunshine and mind and his old workshop
in the old high-roofed town flooded back to
him. “Is voice from heaven twin pea to voice of
earth? I have even heard better voices of
earth!” He seemed again to be working in the
red, pleasant light of his old furnace, knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>good and not-so-good when he met them. He
thought, “If I do not go to sleep I shall be seeing,
hearing, like any madman!” He turned, drew
the scant covering over him and slept.</p>

<p>But the next day Prior Matthew said that he
was not so well, and, on his obedience he drank
again the dark medicine. The taste of it was
stronger, there was more of it. Again he heard
voices. “Are they true voices&mdash;or what?”
But he was dull to them, uncaring of them.
“Surely I would know the ring of gold!”</p>

<p>He grew better, rose from his pallet and moved
about the cell, was permitted now to go, when
rang the bell, into church. Sent there for penance
one winter eve between vespers and compline, he
suddenly, at a turn of the stone corridor, dark,
chill and deserted, saw what he must suppose to
be a vision. There was a great patch of light
and in it a man standing who must be Saint Willebrod
because he was dressed and coloured and
more or less featured like Saint Willebrod in the
painting on the wall, and he carried a silver cross.
Brother Richard stood still. Then, making to
advance, his foot struck some obstruction. Weakened
as he was, he stumbled and fell. When he
could rise the vision was gone.</p>

<p>Only Vanity could explain why the Prior
should become his confessor. The fact of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>voices and the vision was drawn forth. “You
are greatly honoured, my son! If greater favour
yet comes to you, forget not humility&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he told of his own honesty how cold voices
and vision left his heart, how unamazed his mind,
and that he could but think them dreams of his
sickness somehow bodied forth. The Prior looked
sternly and shook his head. “They come truly,
we hold! But it is seen that thou art as dull as
ditch water&mdash;black ember that will not respond&mdash;tongue
that hath lost taste&mdash;soul that will not
be fervent! Scourge thyself into meekness to
heaven&mdash;into that glow that will take whatever
cometh!”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield plied the scourge. He was
weak now and his eyes dazzled, and truly phantasies
pageanted before him in sound and line and
colour. He saw images, and sometimes they were
beautiful and sometimes deadly. He heard
sounds, and some were honey-sweet and others
grating or mocking. But still said his being,
“They come from no High Reality. Have I not,
being artist, always in some sort heard and seen?
O God, O God! help thou me who am dead!”</p>

<p>Prior Matthew regarded him darkly. Westforest
rode one day to Silver Cross, talked there
with Abbot Mark. “There has been mistake!
He is not your Friar Paul kind!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>The Abbot’s pride arose. “For three years
Silver Cross hath seen him one apart!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! He would not,” said Matthew
sourly, “have far to go, as monks are in these
days, to stand apart and above. My point is that
you cannot make him ecstatic. So far it is beyond
me to set the mill running! He hath been ill, and
his body hath arrived at emaciation. I have given
him that elixir you wot of. Usually it sets the
fancy skipping, brews a kind of wild readiness at
seeing, hearing! And, if I read him aright, he
wants heaven to descend upon him. I provided
him to hear and see one who told him he was Saint
Willebrod. Brother Anselm, you know, whom I
took from among the players, and is&mdash;God pardon
us!&mdash;as dog to my hand&mdash;” He spread
out his hands.</p>

<p>The Abbot groaned. “The end that we propose
is good!”</p>

<p>“Assuredly it is! It all goes into the homely
bag of homely deceits necessary in this poor
world. But the end is that as yet we have done
naught!”</p>

<p>The Abbot sighed. “Could we take him into
counsel?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what shall we do? You have heard
that Saint Leofric healed the French Knight?
He gave candlesticks of pure gold. Shall we give
it all up, Matthew?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. If I could find his true heart and
mind&mdash;then might we beckon appearances that
corresponded. He seems interested in a far land
and in somehow going there&mdash;and going has to
be bodily, all of him! What appears will have to
strike him down, like Saint Paul on Damascus
road&mdash;clean him of doubt, be a blaze to him, a
burning bush!”</p>

<p>The Abbot sighed. Prior Matthew sat fixed,
with cloudy brows, seeking inspiration.</p>

<p>He returned to Westforest. The next day, sitting
in Prior’s stall in the cold, small church, he
kept his eyes fast upon the monk Richard. He
noted his turning, he noted his uplifted, now
bloodless face, and his eyes directed to the copy
of the Silver Cross picture. Prior Matthew half
closed his own eyes, covered, as was his wont
when he was playing chess, his mouth with his
hand.</p>

<p>Again the Prior sat as confessor. The kneeling
monk met gathered subtlety and old skill. Deep,
recessed matters, loves and longings, must come
forth.</p>

<p>The Prior listened, questioned, listened, and at
both was skilfull. He imposed penance, and in
part it was to be performed at Silver Cross,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>“&mdash;returning there as you do, my son, this
week.”</p>

<p>The monk bowed his head. He had not known
when, or indeed if ever, he should return to Silver
Cross. It was among his efforts at self-crucifixion
not to care. As it was his effort here and
at Silver Cross to withdraw attention from outward
happenings, outward talk. No other of his
brethren knew so little as he of the flare and clang
about Saint Leofric.</p>

<p>He returned to Silver Cross. The bell rang
for the noon office. He went into church with his
brethren. With them he bowed, stood, chanted,
kneeled. It was nigh to Christmas tide, a clear
winter day. The sun dwelled in each jewel pane
of the windows and shot thence arrows of love.
The sun blessed nave and aisles and high groined
roof. The candles stood like angels, the great
picture glowed. It was a home-coming. Warmness
wrapped his heart that had been naked and
desolate. All grew fair, honest, friendly. He
was glad to see the Brothers, even those he had
most distasted, glad to see Abbot Mark, cloister
and church, all things! Out of topaz and amber
a beam touched the carven tomb of Montjoy’s
wife. It warmed the Lady Isabel, lying in robe
and mantle with a half smile upon her face. Not
Montjoy only, but also Richard Englefield thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>stone form and face had strange likeness to those
of the Glorified in the picture. Now the light
warmed her, too, the pale, golden lady, so still, so
still, waiting for the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Amber light, topaz light. But on the great picture
every heart-red, every heavenly blue, every
rose and every lily, the upward flowing amethyst
and the diamond light above, where no more might
be seen. His heart bowed, his heart grew alive.
“Ah, Blessed among women, I am come back!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">William</span>, Lord of Montjoy, was ignorant of
what machinations might be in progress up the
Vale of Wander. The Abbot had said, “Would
he be helpful? It is for the glory of Silver Cross
church, which, truly, is for him his lady whom he
must serve!”</p>

<p>The Prior shook his head. “No! No more
than that monk himself! Let him think naught
save that there is holiness there!”</p>

<p>Abbot Mark drew groaning breath. “There
was&mdash;there is&mdash;there shall be&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Montjoy, in his castle yard, played for exercise
at buffets with the squire Ralph, then turned to
castle wall, and with his arms resting upon stone
parapet, looked downward and outward, gargoyle-wise.
But he was not such; he was living knight,
struggling to reach Heavenly City.</p>

<p>It was snowing. Montjoy, wrapped in mantle,
drew hood over head and let it snow. The flakes
fell thickly, large and white. Castle rock dropped
black to castle hill that was whitening. Hill met
Middle Forest that piled toward hill. The roofs
were high, the roofs were steep. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>brown, they were black, they were whitening.
Where were chimneys rose feathers of smoke.
These were houses full and well-to-do. There
were chimneys unfeathered.</p>

<p>Sweet&mdash;sweet, deep&mdash;deep, went Saint Ethelred’s
bell. Sweet&mdash;sweet, deep&mdash;deep, the bell
of the Poor Clares. Sweet&mdash;sweet, deep&mdash;deep,
the bell of the small Carmelite house. The snow
was a veil, but he saw the river and the whitening
bridge. Across, Saint Leofric’s mount might
hardly be seen, might be guessed, as it were&mdash;cloud
friary, cloud church, cloud houses around,
all set in a cloud. Thick, thick fell the snow in
great flakes.</p>

<p>Sweet&mdash;sweet, deep&mdash;deep rang the bells.
He thought he could hear Saint Leofric’s. On a
clear day when the wind was right, he could hear
from this wall, far and thin, the bells of Silver
Cross. To-day it could not be for this ever-passing,
ever-present wall in white motion. Yet he
imaged the hearing. Silver Cross&mdash;Westforest
up Wander&mdash;Saint Leofric&mdash;Saint Ethelred&mdash;Poor
Clares&mdash;Carmelite&mdash;they rang, and it was
Christmas season.</p>

<p>Montjoy’s dark and serious eyes grew misty.
“We strive and buffet&mdash;cross joys, cross wills&mdash;yet,
O true Lord, every bell is sweet! Even Saint
Leofric’s&mdash;” He gripped with energy the stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>coping. “But it is so despite thee, Hugh, despite
thy lying that one day shall choke thee!”</p>

<p>Silver Cross bells swung to the inner sense.
They chimed, they rang unearthly clear and sweet,
they rang clean. “Faulty is the time, and Silver
Cross has been faulty&mdash;but never and never and
never has it been nor will it be branded thief&mdash;as
you, O Hugh, have branded that which was given
you in charge!”</p>

<p>The snow fell, the snow fell. The roofs
whitened, whitened. The smoke feathers that
had been pale against dark now were dark against
pale. The river and the bridge began to be hidden.</p>

<p>There was a high-roofed house with more than
one great chimney stack out of which rose and
waved full and plumy smoke feathers. Down
chimney great burning logs, flame wrapped and
purring, made the house warm, it being the house
of the merchant Eustace Bettany. Alongside
stood his warehouse and his shop, and one passed
by doors from the one into the other. His house
was clean, well-fitted. To-day, it being Christmas
tide, he had shut shop and given holiday, and was
gone, he and his wife and two daughters, to a
kinsman’s house to dine and talk around kinsman’s
fire, and listen to some music from viols
and rebecs. His son, young Thomas, had turned
wilful and would not go. Nor would he, this day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>go to seek a jolly crew in some tavern. He often
enough did that, but to-day his mood was indoors.
Having house to himself, he piled on wood and
summoned John Cobb. “You’ve on your mad
dreaming cap!” said the latter.</p>

<p>Thomas plied the ash stick. “If I have not a
play to go to, must I not make the play? I cannot
sit still. I must run, dance, fly. I would a witch
would come down chimney and show me how!”</p>

<p>John Cobb crossed himself.</p>

<p>The fire burned, the fire sang. The snow fell,
large flakes, white, down coming with an intimate,
cool grace.</p>

<p>Somerville rode into town. He rode musingly,
wrapped in a great grey mantle, with a wide, grey,
stiffened felt hat, keeping snow from him much
like a shed roof. He had ridden from manor to
Silver Cross where he had been entertained. Now
he rode on to Middle Forest, and he rode in a deep
study. Certain muscles twitched in his odd,
brown face. Upon setting out he had not meant
to go farther than Silver Cross. He hardly knew
why he should ride on down Wander. Perhaps
he might think that he wanted time to think. But
below consciousness decisions were already made,
actions acted. That was what drew the muscles
about mouth and eyes and, sitting in his wrist,
turned his big bay horse down Wander, not up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>He might think that he was thinking, but old life
was acting after old fashion. He rode through
falling snow, and he rode not in the mood of one
night at Morgen Fay’s, but in a pleasanter, brisker
mood. He felt amused, speculative, genial, triumphant.
It was well to find human nature
through and through the ancient, pleasant, faulty
pattern! He did not dislike it&mdash;marry, no! It
strengthened, buttressed, warmed and pleased
his sense of himself to feel warp and woof so
continuous.</p>

<p>Silver Cross had this day withdrawn all claim
to that debated good mile of land. It had acknowledged
Somerville’s right. Parchment crackled
in his pocket, parchment with Abbot Mark’s name
and seal at bottom. Land at last in his hand.
Why? Somerville knew why. “I am bought
for the miracles.” Laughter played over his
quick face.</p>

<p>Prior Matthew had “chanced” to be at Silver
Cross. “He is the puppet master!”</p>

<p>Nothing had been divulged as to form of puppets,
or that there were puppets, or for that matter
miracles. Certainly nothing was said of purchase.
All had been warm, friendly, with an air
of Yule. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>“But when there are miracles&mdash;believe
and cry aloud that it is so! Never bring cold to
wither them, snow to cover them! Be a friend,
and in our camp!” Somerville laughed. After
an old habit, he hummed, he sang as he rode:</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>He looked through snow to castle rock. “Ha,
Montjoy, do you escape?”</p>

<p>For a moment a hand, as it were, wiped life
from his face, leaving it haggard and empty. But
witches trooped at whistle, sardonic mirth came
back. “We buy and we are bought! Why not&mdash;if
the world is Pennyworth Fair? If little
good is had, so is little harm. It’s an empty barn,
Montjoy, where the wind whistles!</p>

<p>He rode through Middle Forest High Street
and coming to the door of Master Eustace Bettany,
dismounted and knocked. John Cobb let
him in, and Thomas Bettany was most glad to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>see him. But he would not tarry. He had
stopped in passing to ask Thomas to make him a
visit at Somerville Hall. Thomas was blithe to
say yes,&mdash;if his father could spare him.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will spare you!” said Somerville intelligently.</p>

<p>His sworn follower laughed a little. In truth
Somerville was important. Merchants spared
sons to visit knights.</p>

<p>He mounted the big bay, he rode on down High
Street. Thomas and John Cobb watched from
the door dwindling horse and man, taken into the
snow world and hidden there. Then they shook
from their coats the flakes big as guilders and returned
to the fire. “Now you’ve got your pleasure
and your play! Did your witch bring him
though?”</p>

<p>“No!” His blue eyes regarded John Cobb
with a bright and distant look. “I’ll take you
with me, John, for my man&mdash;”</p>

<p>The snow fell. The roof, the streets all were
white. Sound wrapped itself in wool, in far time.
The folk in the ways, the carts and wagons, the
strong horses, went in a wafted veil. It witched
them, witched the place and hour. As the snow
fell fewer and fewer were abroad. Somerville
also heard the bells ring.</p>

<p>Morgen Fay’s house watched the head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>old wall grow white, and the bridge grow white,
and the flakes melt in the river. A dusky plume
waved from the chimney. Below was burning
wood, and Morgen Fay moved from it to window
and from window back again.</p>

<p>She was glad to see Somerville. “If ever I
needed counsel, I need it now! What is Ailsa?
She cannot give it, nor can Tony! What are the
others who come here? They have not thy wit,
or they are too young or too old. Montjoy has
wiped me from his dear soul!”</p>

<p>“Your eyes are red. Were you weeping for
that?”</p>

<p>“No! And I wept not much. It does no good.
My cousin, Father Edwin, is dead.”</p>

<p>“I knew not that he ailed!”</p>

<p>“Ay, he is dead. And there comes to me warning
that Father Edmund will preach against me
in Saint Ethelred and at town cross.”</p>

<p>“Can there arrive great harm? Middle
Forest likes thee pretty well!”</p>

<p>“Oh, once, I know, I might have sailed out of
storm&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why not again?”</p>

<p>“With the miracles&mdash;with Saint Leofric blazing
there? Middle Forest is become good! I
tell you I see before me stoning and misery!”</p>

<p>He studied the fire. He was inclined to agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>with her that her hour had struck. “Well! You
have had years of down-lined nest&mdash;of merry
life!”</p>

<p>“So wind will blow less cold and stones bruise
less? Merry life? Oh, aye, sometimes!”</p>

<p>“What will you do to escape?”</p>

<p>“Marry, tell me! Tell me, Rob!”</p>

<p>She came and put her hand upon his breast. She
felt him draw slightly back from her. She stood
away herself and her dark eyes pierced him; she
sighed. Presently she said, “Thou, too! thou,
too! Well, out of common decency, counsel
me!”</p>

<p>He cogitated. “While there is yet time you
might get secretly away&mdash;to London or elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want not to go! This is home. I
should miss my river and my garden.”</p>

<p>“Montjoy?”</p>

<p>“In old days he might&mdash;because that I look
like that Isabel who looked like Our Lady in the
Silver Cross picture. But now I know not that
he would shield, nor that he could. He hath put
himself awry with all the folk.”</p>

<p>Somerville laughed. “Aye, I have seen that!
Let him speak now against rising zeal at his peril!
Out upon him will rush the hive!”</p>

<p>He sat regarding her with very bright eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>“Man lives to learn! Until this moment I knew
not that of Montjoy, nor that you are like&mdash;as
now I see you are like&mdash;that picture! Why did
you never tell me that?”</p>

<p>“I know not. I have some grace&mdash;like a little
star, far, far away!”</p>

<p>He regarded her meditatively. “You are a
mixture! A hand shakes the phial until the dregs
are on top.”</p>

<p>“I wish they were skimmed off and thrown
away. But all of me might then be gone, oh, all
of me! Tell me what I am to do, Robert!”</p>

<p>Leaning back in his chair, he looked now at her
and now at the fire. “Priest against priest!
Father Edwin dead. Seek afield. None at the
Carmelites, no! Saint Leofric gives no help.
Silver Cross&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Abbot Mark must trot his mule beside
Zeal-for-goodness! Not else can he keep apace
with the time!” Morgen Fay burst into laughter.
She laughed, and then she sat silent with
her head bowed upon the settle’s arm.</p>

<p>“If he preaches&mdash;Father Edmund&mdash;at town
cross, best were it that you disappear.”</p>

<p>“Lock house against better days and vanish&mdash;aye,
where?”</p>

<p>“There’s many a place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, far away. I do not will to go far away.
May not I have true love beside all the untrue?”</p>

<p>“Poor wretch! It is nigh smothered!” said
Somerville and laughed; after which he sat in
silence and all manner of odd and mocking lights
played in his face. “Well, disappear up
Wander!”</p>

<p>“How far up?”</p>

<p>“Well, not as far as Somerville Hall. That
may not be. But there is the ruined farm that
bears toward Silver Cross. Put on country dress
and darken your face, and David and his wife who
live there will take you in&mdash;Alice or Joan. I
will speak to them. You may bide there until we
are less good.”</p>

<p>There was silence. A red coal fell with a silken
sound. Out of window all was white and still.
“I despair,” said Morgen Fay. “Not for this
danger nor for that but I&mdash;I myself. I despair.”</p>

<p>“If there were any way to buy Silver
Cross&mdash;” He sat and looked into the fire.</p>

<p>The snow fell thick, thick and white. It hid
the bridge, it hid Saint Leofric, it hid the castle
of Montjoy. It wrapped the town. Dusk came to
help it. Snow and night wrapped the time and
place.</p>

<p>In the night it ceased to snow and cleared.
Winter stars and purple dawn and saffron day.
The sun sprang up and beneath him lay a diamond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>earth. Somerville, riding up Wander, pulled his
hat over eyes, so dazzling were the light shafts.</p>

<p>Out from the road that turned aside to Silver
Cross came upon his mule the Prior of Westforest,
attended by two monks. There was greeting.
“Ride on with me to Westforest, Sir
Robert!”</p>

<p>They rode together and when they came to
Westforest Somerville dismounted and went with
Prior Matthew into his parlour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="10">X</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Brother Anselm</span> had been transferred, it
seemed, from Westforest to Silver Cross. Richard
Englefield found him here, and in the cell that
had been Brother Oswald’s. The latter, with
Brothers Peter, Allen and Timothy, were gone
into dormitory. Only Brother Norbert was left.
In the six cells dwelled Brother Anselm, Brother
Norbert and himself. There had been other
changes. A great rood was put up in his cell.
Broad and dark, a poor wooden Christ hanging
thereon, it overspread a third of one side of the
cell. It stood there, shadowy against a shadowy
wall, as all the cell was shadowy,&mdash;the thin winter
light stealing in by day, the one taper by night.</p>

<p>Richard Englefield the goldsmith had seen
many a great rood in England and France and
Italy. He had seen poor carving, rude and struggling
thought and unskilful hand, hardly attaining
to truth, hardly to strength, hardly to beauty. But
beauty and strength and truth had been longed
for. This carving, this rood, showed him no
such thing. “Not the way it is done, but the
dream is wrong.” It grew faintly horrible to
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>The long winter days, the knees upon stone.
“O God, O God! Where is light, where is meaning?
In me is wold and thicket and bog and the
stars put out!”</p>

<p>Only the picture stayed with him, made somehow
significance, somehow warmth. Now it
paled and now it glowed.</p>

<p>He ate little, slept little. He crucified his body.
Like the insistent sweet ringing of a bell, forever,
forever, Silver Cross suggested, suggested.
Surely, in some sort, heaven should descend! He
was earning it. He began to have visions, but
they were pale, confused, forms without significance
or with the significance hidden. They
said naught that might lift the Abbey of Silver
Cross to a height that should equal Saint
Leofric’s mount.</p>

<p>Twelfth night&mdash;Candlemas Day&mdash;Lent in
sight&mdash;and Saint Leofric blazing high! Not
that only, but Middle Forest beginning to manifest
holiness and uncloak sin. Father Edmund
of Saint Ethelred had no vision but the vision of
a rod for the wicked. But he had a preaching
power! He stood upon the steps of town cross
and his white heat turned the icicles to water.
The sinner, Morgen Fay, was fled,&mdash;none knew
whither. They said likely to London town. They
sacked her house, they drummed the old woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>and the youth, her servants, out of town. Both
sides of river and up Wander vale, enthusiasm
gathered light in eyes, red in cheeks. There began
to be prophets and religious dancers. In Middle
Forest High Street appeared a band of flagellants.
The air was taking fire. “Now, now or
never!” said Prior Matthew.</p>

<p>The ruined farm, that had been small and poor
even before fire had half destroyed it, stood
gaunt, blackened, sunk in loneliness behind winter
forest through which few walked. Margery and
David, blear-eyed and simple, living in the part
that held together, found the helper-woman, Joan,
strong but moody, now ready to laugh at a little
thing and now dark as a tempest over the wood
that shut out the world. Somerville the master
had said, “Take her!” They had obeyed, and
if they speculated it was sluggishly.</p>

<p>Past the holly copse stretched land of Silver
Cross, woodland with a woodman’s path through.
Somerville came by this. He talked with Joan
or with Morgen Fay under the hollies where the
berries were so red and the leaves so glossy and
barbed. She said vehemently, “No!” and she
said, “No!” and “No!” again, but more dully,
pettishly.</p>

<p>“It’s sin. I’ve done much, but I haven’t done
that!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>“You choose then a powerful enemy&mdash;”</p>

<p>She raised her arms above her head. “If you
will show me where the world is not wicked&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Psha! Do you remember a foggy night
when we talked? Return to that mood and say,
‘It is a play, and I can do it wonderfully!’ You
could&mdash;you can!”</p>

<p>“I do not see that Abbot Mark can harm me
more than I am harmed!”</p>

<p>“Think you so? Should there come a band of
monks to break the house and hale you forth&mdash;strip
you and fling you into Wander, or maybe
into fire? If Silver Cross but speaks to Saint
Ethelred, Abbot Mark to Father Edmund? If
I withdraw my hand? Do not look like a queen
in a book! I mean only that in no wise can I
save you further. Montjoy is not powerful
enough, even if he would, and I have here less
power of arm than has he. You must save yourself.”</p>

<p>“I think that your Abbot Mark and Prior Matthew
are devils!”</p>

<p>“No. They are not. They are honest men
trying to assure and increase that which they hold
to be their own. Human stuff, even as you
and I!”</p>

<p>“Human stuff! Well, I would choose another
stuff if I might!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>“No, you would not, poor Morgen Fay, by the
chill Wander! You chose this. Well, will you,
or will you not?”</p>

<p>“I will not.”</p>

<p>“You think that you will not. However, you
will. If you do not you are lost.”</p>

<p>“Lost to what?”</p>

<p>“Well, to ease&mdash;to your own kind of command&mdash;finally
perhaps to your life.”</p>

<p>She said in a strangled voice. “As I came here
to this house so will I walk on by day or by night
and come to another town.”</p>

<p>He turned quickly. “Try it!&mdash;or rather do
not try it! You will find that you cannot.”</p>

<p>The holly berries were red, the leaves glossy
and barbed. She looked at the pale winter sky.
“Is it sky? It seems to me a poor tent that we
have struggled to get up&mdash;poor, mean, low,
ragged. I would it might fall and kill us!”</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently. “No, you do not so!
Any day you could kill yourself. But you love
life. Go to, now! Look at the curious dance of
the time correctly! Mumming is no great sin.
What! All the saints and higher than the saints
were on the market-place stage last Middle Forest
Fair. They talked and walked&mdash;even the Highest!
Very good! It is but Miracle Play again,
and truly for no ill ends&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>Red holly berries, barbed leaves. He won her
to stand and listen, though with heaving bosom
and dark brows. Pale sky and voice of Wander
and birds of winter in naked oak and beech. The
ruined farm&mdash;and her house above the river and
her garden turned against her. Father Edmund
preaching at town cross against the wicked time
and each remaining sin&mdash;and they had swept up
her house and garden and drummed forth Ailsa
and Tony, who were God knew where! And
Montjoy nor any cared any longer! Barbed
leaves and miserable world bent on injury! He
won her to nod her head and then to break into
reckless laughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> monk Richard awoke, he knew not why.
He woke widely, collectedly, his forces drawn to
a point of expectation. “Awake, awake!
Look!” seemed to echo in his soul that had suddenly
grown quiet. When he had slept his cell
was flooded by the moon. Still there was her silver
light. He sat up. He was with absoluteness
aware of a presence in the cell. Never before, in
his pale visions, had he had this sense of startling,
of reality,&mdash;not at Westforest, not here at Silver
Cross. He knew that there was a being in his
cell. Neither could he nor did he doubt it. A
voice spoke to him, and it was golden-sweet and
rich and wonderful. “Richard!”</p>

<p>He turned himself. Light that was not moonlight,
though it blended with the moonlight, and
in it, <em>real</em>, the Blessed among women!</p>

<p>Could he doubt? It was the great picture come
alive! Could he doubt? She spoke&mdash;and he
had not uttered that dart of thought. “Not that
that painter could see me as I am in glory&mdash;but
knowing that thou lovest me so, I come to thee
so! I come to thee as thou canst see me, Richard!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>She was <em>real</em>, she was not tinted air. <em>Real</em>&mdash;oh,
<em>real</em>! Soft playing light was about her feet,
her form, her head, her outspread and glorious
dark hair. Her eyes were books, her mouth upland
meadows of flowers; the blue and red of her
dress, her mantle, trembled and was alive. Life
went out of her toward him, his life leaped to
meet it. Life at last, <em>life</em>! <em>life</em>! He sprang from
his pallet, he kneeled in his monk’s robe. He put
his forehead to the stone.</p>

<p>The voice came again&mdash;oh, the voice! “Richard,
list to me!”</p>

<p>All heaven was speaking to him and filling
him&mdash;him, him who had been so unhappy!&mdash;with
joy and power.</p>

<p>“Thou hast loved me well, and so thou hast
drawn me, servant Richard, knight Richard, my
poet Richard! I love all places&mdash;but now I
love this place well and would do it good.”</p>

<p>He found daring to speak. “Star of me&mdash;Bringer
of me into full being&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou canst not know all the counsel of
heaven. I will come again, renewing thy joy.
But now hearken what thou art to do, unquestioning,
as thou lovest me! The morn comes.
When rings the bell for lauds, when thy brethren
flock into church, haste thou, haste! Stand before
them. Cry, thou that lovest me. ‘This night
hath the Blessed among women appeared to me,
Richard Englefield!’ And she saith, ‘Speak to
all of Silver Cross, and say thou for me, Of old
I loved this place, and I will love it again, for I
see it returning to its first strength and worship!’
Say thou, ‘I will give it room again in men’s
minds. I will return and show a thing whereby
multitudes shall be healed and glory shall
come!’”</p>

<p>There was pause, then “Be thou he, Richard,
who loveth me well, through whom I shall speak!
Morn cometh. The bell begins to ring.”</p>

<p>The soft, the playing light withdrew. He felt
her still&mdash;oh, <em>real</em>!&mdash;then in the darkness, into
it, behind it as it were, she was gone. He knew
that she was gone into utter light.</p>

<p>But here was vacancy, faint moonbeams, a cell
of shadows. But the comfort and the passion and
the splendour were in his heart, his veins, his
blood, in the potent cells of his body! With
power, with success, they summoned the brain to
do them service. He believed like a child, and he
was the impassioned lover.</p>

<p>He felt more than man. A great lightness and
gaiety, a rest upon promise, held him one moment,
and the next a longing, an agony,&mdash;and all was
huge and resonant, deep, wide and high; and all
was fine and small and subtle and profoundly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>home! Time and space had radically changed
for him.</p>

<p>He was yet kneeling when the bell for lauds
began to ring. Rising, he saw through the window
the setting moon,&mdash;then he was gone.</p>

<p>The candles were lighted. It was not Abbot
Mark’s wont to be seated there, in Abbot’s stall,
for lauds. But he was here, picked out by the
light. The hollow of the church was all dark; the
choir, the ranged monks, thinly dyed with amber.
When he passed the tomb of the Lady of Montjoy
he thought that a warmer light laved it, touching
the stone almost to life. But the great picture&mdash;ah,
the great picture! He lifted to it light-filled
eyes. She was there&mdash;she was in heaven&mdash;she
had stood in his cell. His being was in her hands;
he lay with the Babe in her arms.</p>

<p>He would give her message rightly! It seemed
almost that the church waited for it, the windows
where the dawn was bringing faint, faint colours.
A great wave of feeling swept him, affection and
pity for Silver Cross. Once it had been saintly
and a light for all wanderers. Dear would it be,
dear and rich and sweet if it all could come again,
the old, simple power!</p>

<p>With that he heard his own voice, as it were the
voice of another, lifted but profound, too, a deep,
a rushing music, since what he had to tell was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>heaven’s music. The Abbot summoned him to
stand upon the step, lifted high above Silver
Cross monks. He gave forth her words, and the
world seemed to him an altar, and the candles
suns, and he felt himself that he spoke like a
strong angel.</p>

<p>There were ejaculations, cries of praise,
snatches of prayers. The Abbot kneeled&mdash;the
sub-prior&mdash;all! The picture seemed to glow,
to bend forward, to bless. In the faces of the simpler
monks sat pure awe and belief. Some wept.
There were two or three ecstatic faces. Those
who had been lazy or proud or sensual or lying
showed to his thinking smitten. He had not liked
them, but now they were like poor faulty children
to him, to be loved still, so brimming was his
power!</p>

<p>Brother Norbert, whom certainly he had not
liked, cried aloud, “Now Silver Cross shines
again&mdash;shines brighter than the bones of Saint
Leofric!”</p>

<p>Brother Norbert, too, stepped into the deep-throbbing
inner Paradise. While there arose a
cry of “Praise Our Lady!”&mdash;while the Abbot
kneeled before her image&mdash;while, as though she
had said “Sing!” the church filled with singing,
Brother Richard knew bliss. The dawn was in
the windows, the great sun struck through, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>was golden day. But his thought was, “Will she
come to-night?”</p>

<p>The day was on him, and it was unsupportable,
with the fervour, with the talking, with the restlessness
of the Abbey-fold. He had longing to go
to his old workroom, to light the furnace, to take
up work. But that had been long forbidden. It
was March. Lay Brothers and tenants were
plowing Abbey fields. He would have worked
with them, but again was forbidden. But he
had at least permission to go forth under open
sky. He might walk in orchard or garden.
Silence was enjoined. He felt no sorrow as to
that; silence was needed to talk with Heaven.</p>

<p>The March day was bright, sunny, still, not
cold. Two Abbey men were pruning the fruit
trees. Richard Englefield signed that he would
help. He worked for hours and the work was welcome.
He must steady himself in order to feel
again and again and steadily&mdash;in order to know
every strange flower and divine essential thread!</p>

<p>Long day went slow-footed by, and yet were
its moments gems and blossoms. He did not reason,
he did not think; he only knew strange bliss
and strange pain and expected both to continue.</p>

<p>Vespers&mdash;the picture&mdash; the Magnificat. Exalted
as he was he knew that there was exaltation
about him, in the church. Did he care to bring it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>before his mind he would have agreed that by now
tidings of so great import must have gone here,
gone there. No more than incense or music or
light could it be kept at the starting point! Presently
it would be far and near.</p>

<p>Prior Matthew of Westforest sat next the Abbot’s
stall. That was to be expected, Silver Cross
and Westforest being mother and daughter. The
hollow of the church showed clusters of folk
from Wander side. That, too, was to be looked
for. The Lord of Montjoy stood beside the tomb
of Isabel; often he came to Silver Cross, and it
was not to be wondered at that he was here to-day,
summoned doubtless by Abbot Mark. Montjoy’s
dark face showed exaltation. It glowed;
you would have said there was personal triumph.
Richard Englefield felt for Montjoy sudden kinship
and liking.</p>

<p>What faces were turned to him, what looks
were cast upon him, what watchings, what judgments,
hopes, he knew not. After the first habitual
sweep of the eye, after the first movement of
spirit toward Montjoy, he was the picture’s.</p>

<p>The church grew wide as earth. The chanting
went up long coloured lanes to heaven’s gate.
The setting sun sang, and the rising moon sang,
and the stars, as through the dusk they strode
nearer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>It was night. He was alone in his cell. Again
he slept. He waked and knew that he was in her
presence.</p>

<p>Softened glory, diminished that he might see
her as he could see her. Her red and her blue, her
form, her face, her voice&mdash;kneeling, he trembled
with his joy as with a burden too great to bear.
It was as ocean wave to a babe. Vast, crested, it
curved above him. His life might go&mdash;he cared
not for that, if on the other side of life he might
still adore!</p>

<p>The voice! “Richard! Say thou for me to
Silver Cross, ‘Go by the orchard, go by the hill
where feed the sheep. Go to where shines a fir
tree against the steep hill. Beside it you will
find fallen earth and a little cave made bare, and
in the stone over the cave my name. Let the Abbot
of Silver Cross and the holiest among you
enter. There shall you find a little well of clear
water, and by token beside it a rose. The well
hath been blessed by me and by all the host of
heaven. Make you of the grot a chapel. Set my
image there; make it a place that I may love.
Make for the well a pool, and whosoever drinks
of it and whosoever bathes therein, if he have
faith he shall be completely healed, be he ill either
of body or estate!’”</p>

<p>The music fell, then rose again. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>“That is my
task for thee, Richard! That is the errand thou
wilt do for me.”</p>

<p>The voice ceased. He thought that the light
began to go away, her form to dim. He cried
aloud, fear pushing him to wild utterance. “I
will do it! But wilt thou come again? I may
not live unless thou wilt come!”</p>

<p>There seemed pause, then said the voice like
the balm of the world. “I will come once again&mdash;and
perhaps thereafter, so thou servest me
firmly!” And, as he bowed his head, as tears
of sweetness, of exquisite rest in her word, rushed
to his eyes, she was gone. Darkness&mdash;and again
through the window the declining moon, and immediately
the bell for the dawn office.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="12">XII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver Cross</span> went in procession. The Abbot
with the Prior of Westforest walked ahead and
there followed chanting monks. Then came lay
Brothers and villagers and a quarter of the countryside
and a half-score from Middle Forest. The
Lord of Montjoy walked. Bright was the morning,
high and crisp; white frost on ground.
Rounding the hill they cried, “The fir tree!”</p>

<p>They knew not how it was, but the tree, the
first confirmation, seemed to spring before them,
magical, mighty, a veritable tree of life. Many
may have noted it before, through the years,
standing like a sentinel before the hill, and
thought only, “A great tree, with good shade for
shepherds in hot summer tide!” But now
marvel clothed it.</p>

<p>The wind began to play through the stretched
wires of Imagination. The harp was sounding.</p>

<p>It was the Prior of Westforest who cried, “Lo,
the fallen earth! Not touched from without,
but pushed from within!”</p>

<p>It lay in truth, sod, earth and rock, to right and
left, as though Might would come forth and had
done so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>The procession broke from column into a
throng as of bees, eyes toward their queen. There
was the opening into the hill like a door with a
great stone for lintel. The Abbot spoke to the
monk Richard. “Read thou!” A breath of
assent ran like wind through wheat. “Aye, aye,
the one she came to!”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield read the name cut there and
gave it to the folk as he had given in Silver Cross
church the message. Tall, spare, gold-brown, in
daily seeming stripped to simplicity and quietude,
but now with that around him that made for
catching of the breath, he stood and read and
turned and gave the name of the Blessed among
women.</p>

<p>The Abbot and the Prior of Westforest entered
the small cavern. The bright sun was there; it
was light enough. With them they took the monk
Richard, and Brother Oswald whom all knew for
right monk and Brother Ralph. There entered,
too, the Lord of Montjoy. At first he would not.
“She saith, Take the good&mdash;” But the Abbot
drew him by the hand. There went in likewise
one from Middle Forest,&mdash;Father Edmund the
Preacher.</p>

<p>There was the well,&mdash;a little basin of clear
water bubbling from the farther rock. It was
March and the world leafless. But close beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>the water lay a fresh rose, nor red nor white, of a
colour like the dawn. Stem and leaf and blossom
it lay, and in the water appeared its likeness.
The Abbot stooped toward it. Montjoy laid hand
on him. “No! Let this man lift it!” He and
Richard Englefield and Brothers Oswald and
Ralph saw a transfigured rose. It glowed, it
beat; it was seen through tears.</p>

<p>Brother Richard kneeled before it, touched it
with his forehead. Then in his two hands he bore
it through the opening of the grot and showed it,
lifted, to the folk.</p>

<p>Out of the hushed throng rang a voice. “The
cave and well of Our Lady of the Rose!”</p>

<p>“That is it! That is it! Our Lady of the
Rose!”</p>

<p>The Abbot lifted his hands. “It shall be kept
for aye in reliquary. Lord of Montjoy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will give the reliquary!” Montjoy saw in
imagination the rose blooming for aye, sending
through gold and precious stones light and fragrance
to Isabel.</p>

<p>It seemed that the sub-prior had brought from
the Abbot’s house a silver dish and a square of
fine white linen. Brother Richard laid the rose
in the silver thing that he himself had carved.</p>

<p>Now all that might would press into the grot.
At last order was had and like links of a massy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>chain in and forth passed the throng. There was
a woman from Wander Mill, dumb for years, and
it was known that she had not won healing from
Saint Leofric. Now she came, she stooped, she
lifted water in her hands and drank. She rose,
she turned, she stammered, made strange sounds,
then burst forth clear. “Praise God! Praise
Blessed Lady!&mdash;Oh, children, I am speaking!”</p>

<p>Tears were in all eyes.</p>

<p>One other was healed that day,&mdash;a man whose
fingers were bent into his hand so that he could
not straighten them nor work at his trade.</p>

<p>There was a great Mass and high devotion at
Silver Cross. There were offerings for at once
lining with fine stone the grotto of Our Lady of
the Rose, for providing a fair, wide basin for the
well, for a glorious image.</p>

<p>Earth, water and air seemed servants to bear
the news. The hum of it was like wild bees
through Wander vale. Middle Forest listened at
sunset to Father Edmund. “True&mdash;true, my
children! We have preached and wrought,
scourging forth evil! This country wins a new
name. From accursed, it becomes blessed!” The
river heard and the bridge and Saint Leofric’s
Mount and the Friary and Prior Hugh. The bells
of Saint Ethelred rang and of the Carmelites and
the Poor Clares. The castle of Montjoy heard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Somerville Hall heard, and the house of Master
Eustace Bettany.</p>

<p>The ruined farm heard,&mdash;but so dull and
trouble-bent were David and Margery that they
cared not. Little things only could get into Margery’s
mind, and a little thing was turning there.
Joan, the helper-woman, slept in a loft that was
reached by an outside stair. Margery had swimming
in the head and feared this stair and rarely
went to loft. But this day Joan might be anywhere,
but could not be found at hand. Margery
climbed the stair and peered about. Very blank
up here, with flock bed and ancient chest and some
hanging things. But in the window under the
thatch, in the sunshine of a mild day, stood the
tiny rose tree that Joan had brought with her
under her cloak when she came to the ruined farm
two months since. She said she brought it because
she loved it, and she begged an earthern jar
and put in rich soil and planted afresh that which
she had taken from such a jar in order to bring it
so great a distance,&mdash;in short from the great
port town twenty leagues away. Now, at the
ruined farm, she must have nourished it well and
kept it warm, for it was green and leafy. Margery,
going over to admire it, set herself to turn
the jar that she might better see. The jar fell and
broke. The earth heaped itself on the floor, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>stem and leaves were bruised. “Alack!” cried
Margery and hurried down stairs, for she thought
she heard Joan. Though in form she was the mistress
it was not so essentially. She explained
volubly when, in another hour, there confronted
her Joan with a shard of the jar in her hand. She
would remember the loft and the little rose tree,
but the news of miracles at Silver Cross, brought
by a straying shepherd, whistled through like
wind over grass that when the stir was gone
forgot.</p>

<p>The March sunset flared splendid. The dusk
fell like violets. The stars, advancing, were taper
flames and an angel vast as all mankind held each.
The moon would not rise till late. “Come, oh,
come, come, Rose of Heaven!” So the monk
Richard Englefield in his dark cell.</p>

<p>He must sleep, he would sleep, he would trust,
not clamor nor force. He slept, he waked; she
was there, she appeared to him. “Rose of
Heaven, Rose of Heaven&mdash;Voice of Heaven,
Blessed One&mdash;My Lady!”</p>

<p>She was there to confirm him in worship, to
say, “Well done, thus far!” to say, “Pray thou&mdash;praise
thou&mdash;live thou, humble, obedient,
shedding holiness on Silver Cross!”</p>

<p>“Wilt thou come again?”</p>

<p>The voice that was music said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>“Live in memory
and live in hoping! But now, Richard, farewell!”</p>

<p>Darkness where had been light. The kneeling
monk stretched his arms, strained his eyes, but
there was darkness. He heard no movement,
but she was not there! Empty cell, and a black
cloud across the moon!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> came no more. Night after night of dark,&mdash;only
the star Memory and the sapphire star of
passionate hope that once again, once again he
would wake, clear, still, and know her there.
“Even after years, oh, heaven that holds her, oh,
God that sustains her! Even after years beyond
counting.”</p>

<p>She came no more. The nights were slow dark
raindrops, heavy, full, one after the other falling,
slow falling, not to be counted. They made
rosaries, they would make rosaries for aye.
“Then I must go to her. Where is the eagle will
show me the path?”</p>

<p>March&mdash;April. The rose in reliquary, the
cave stone lined, the well widened into a fair pool
with steps for going down, for coming up, one in
so many healed! April&mdash;May. Noise of Silver
Cross like a waving of forest trees, like a humming
of all the bees in the meadows. Folk coming,
going; more folk and more folk coming!
At the Abbey a greater guest house in planning;
in shambling village taverns, booths, houses rising.
Pilgrims on foot and pilgrims on horseback
and in litter. A bishop stayed three days in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Abbot’s house, there was rumour that the cardinal
might come. The bells of Silver Cross rang
jubilee.</p>

<p>Middle Forest relied now upon its own
side of the river. Montjoy in his castle looked
younger by ten years. He looked like some crusading
Montjoy of long ago, long ago. The river
murmured of both banks; the bridge seemed to
have two loves. But the mount of Saint Leofric,
though it said, “Praise for doubling!” seemed
rather to wish to say, “Out upon division!”
Prior Hugh, though he spoke gracious words,
looked warped and wan and cogitative.</p>

<p>Early May at the ruined farm and Somerville
and the helping-woman Joan in the forest, under
a beech tree pale green and silver grey, springing
tall and stretching wide. “I will to go back
to my house by the river! All the world is joyous
and grown softened&mdash;Oh, I hear it with the ear
inside of ear and I touch it with the touch inside
of touch! Good was done for all of the evil, was
it not, Rob?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Oh, woman&mdash;! You can’t go
back. Father Edmund has three voices where he
had one! Moreover&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Moreover&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“See you, Morgen, go up to London town.”</p>

<p>“And why should I go to London town?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>“Ask for that Westforest and Silver Cross.”</p>

<p>Under the beech tree was carpet of last year’s
leaves. She lifted and crumbled them in her
hands. “When I said that I would be secret, I
meant not telling! They have no call to fear
me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they tell themselves that. Or perhaps
they see faint menace every time they look
this way!”</p>

<p>“They promised that trouble should cease. I
was going back to my own house over my own
garden, by the river that I like to hear by day, by
night. They said that Father Edmund should be
checked. Presently I was to find that I might
slip back&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is promised is not easy sometimes to
perform. They will give you gold in London.
London is rich, and you are Morgen Fay. Go,
and be powerful there!”</p>

<p>“And you&mdash;and you? Oh, I remember that
you go once in five years to London!”</p>

<p>“If you cried out in Middle Forest market place
what was done not a soul would believe you!”</p>

<p>“No. It is too monstrous!”</p>

<p>“Then and there the folk might tear you limb
from limb for wild blaspheming. They are truly
quite safe.”</p>

<p>She broke into high laughter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>“Then let them
leave me alone, and let them keep promise! It
irks me that they are so false! Here are two
months, and not yet may I go back! And Ailsa
and Tony, where are they? I see them begging
or in gaol!”</p>

<p>“You should be happy,” he said, “that you are
not beggar nor in gaol.”</p>

<p>There fell silence. The beech tree sprang light
green and silver, the sky was blue, the blackbirds
talked, a thrush sang, wandering airs went by.
The world was sweet. But she crushed the dead
leaves and sat still.</p>

<p>“You must go. Need or no need, they will
have it so! Nor can you stay at the ruined farm
forever. Something will happen endangering you&mdash;endangering
me.”</p>

<p>She said. “Is life wicked&mdash;or are we wicked&mdash;or
are we dull and lifeless&mdash;stones, broken
twigs, dead leaves? Many an one says that I am
wicked, and doubtless I am at times. I know it&mdash;I
know it! And then again I am not wicked.
So if I say that you are so, poor Sir Robert Somerville?
Perhaps I am mistaken&mdash;perhaps I am
right. It’s a weary way to knowledge!”</p>

<p>“Were you gentler,” he said, “had you not
such a tongue, you would find that the winds did
not rock your nest so roughly!”</p>

<p>He stood up. “Ah, go!” she said. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>“Go! I
have seen it coming&mdash;now it comes! Your
road’s to John o’ Groat’s house and mine’s to
Land’s End!”</p>

<p>“You mock the wind,” he answered, “with
your nest fixed so firm upon the bough!”</p>

<p>He went away by woodman’s path, and she to
the ruined farm. “Eh, lass!” said Margery at
dusk. “You can work when your mind’s to it!”</p>

<p>The third day from this Somerville and she
were again in the wood. “I am going. It is
trudge! All of you make a north wind that I set
my back against and go! Nor will I cry for it,
Somerville!”</p>

<p>“You have no need to. They shall give you
money. Walk or ride in a cart from here
through the later half of night, keeping disguise.
Come to the port in a day or so and find there the
<i>King Arthur</i> bound for London. Find, too, upon
the ship Ailsa&mdash;”</p>

<p>Red flowed over her face. “Oh, the power
that men, and honest men, own! It is enough
to make one willing to sell soul to devil!”</p>

<p>He waved that aside. “It is for your own
safety that you are going. And were I wholly
wicked I should not be here, nor Ailsa at the port
awaiting you&mdash;”</p>

<p>She said. “That is true. I thank you there,
Rob!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>She broke a spray of hazel, set her teeth in the
green wood, then threw it away. “Shall we say
good-by now, you and I?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet. Something has arisen since we
sat here the other day. I have seen Prior Matthew.”</p>

<p>“Aye?”</p>

<p>“There is needed one more appearance. Question
has arisen as to Saint Willebrod&mdash;if he rests
still or if actively he aids! There are some who
are devoted to him. Once more then!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will not!”</p>

<p>His bright eyes dwelt upon her, all the lights
played in his odd face. “Why not, Morgen?
Be good-natured! I nor none am doing badly by
you.”</p>

<p>“What do you get from this?”</p>

<p>“The old debatable land&mdash;and a piece that was
not debatable. I love land! And I get playgoer’s
enjoyment, watching from a good, quiet
seat&mdash;and comfort that we’re all fruit just pleasantly
specked and wasp-eaten&mdash;and some mirth
from Montjoy’s ecstacy. So be good! What!
There are houses by Thames in London. You
may have a garden still&mdash;plant your rose tree
there.”</p>

<p>It was high May weather. As once before
Thomas Bettany had errand up the Wander,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>merchant
errand of account-to-be-paid. This time
it was with Oak Tree Grange beyond Silver
Cross. He rode in the May tide and with him
rode John Cobb, and they had done the errand.
Oak Tree Grange lay out of the world, and now
they were on a cart track, nothing more.</p>

<p>Young Bettany rode light and happy on his big
grey horse. May world was a fair world, fair,
sweet, gay, kind! He whistled clear and strong.
“I swear I saw God sitting on yon cloud!”</p>

<p>Said John Cobb, “I’m going to Silver Cross to
get this old scar taken off my face.”</p>

<p>“Silver Cross. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>They were riding by a wood, old, uncut, dim.
“This is Somerville’s land now! He always
claimed it, and now the Abbey allows it.”</p>

<p>John Cobb looked about him. “I know now
where we are. Over there, a mile through, is a
ruined farm. Lonely! It’s so lonely you lose
yourself&mdash;and there’s a ghost walks in the
wood.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go look.”</p>

<p>John was not averse, being in the other’s company.
They left cart track and rode over yielding
earth under old trees. There was no path
and the trees must be rounded. The way they
had come sank from sight, almost it might seem
from mind, so quick the place took them. Bettany’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
blue eyes sparkled. He loved all this; he
might come at any moment upon wizard’s tower.
What indeed they came upon was another faint
track, leading north and south. “Abbey is that
way and Somerville Hall that way, and over there
is the turn to the road we left. They come in and
go out that way&mdash;but, Lord, there’s mortal little
travel! You might say it’s a witched place.”</p>

<p>“That is what I like!” said the other. “Oh,
if I might I would travel far!”</p>

<p>They rode as though it were bottom of the sea,
it was so green and silent. Bettany turned in his
saddle and studied the lay of the place. “When
Somerville goes to Silver Cross I think he takes
this way. It’s not so far.”</p>

<p>“Turn here to the ruined farm. David that
lives here, I’ve heard my mother say, was foster
brother to Sir Robert’s father.”</p>

<p>They rode on and now they saw the ruined farm
between the trees. A wreck it seemed, like a
broken ship slipped down to sea floor. Then by
a thorn in bloom stood up Morgen Fay.</p>

<p>“<em>Who are you?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Who are you?</em>”</p>

<p>In a moment she knew him and Bettany knew
her for all her servant dress and stained face.
“How do you come here&mdash;how do you come
here? You are in London&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>John Cobb crossed himself. “Like she be a
sorceress, too&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morgen stepped from the thorn to the side of
the big grey horse. She met blue eyes with dark
eyes. Her lips smiled, her eyes and under her
eyes. “Oh, the saints!” she said. “I can but
be glad to see you, lad! You are no telltale!
Can you teach your man to be none either?”</p>

<p>“I can that. But Morgen Fay, how did you
grow here?”</p>

<p>He swung himself down from his horse and
stood beside her. John Cobb gaped. “Send him
a little away,” she said, “but do not let him out
of sight. This world’s a danger-bush where the
thorn is always near the may!”</p>

<p>They talked. “Do you remember that foggy
day when you climbed through window? I have
not seen you since! I like you, though not the
way that all expect. I wish I might have had you
for brother. Well, they would stone me&mdash;burn
me, maybe&mdash;in the market place, Father Edmund
preaching over me! I dwell at the ruined
farm.”</p>

<p>Intelligence flashed between them. “Somerville
saved you&mdash;put you here. I think the better
of him!” He spoke sturdily, a young spiritual
adventurer.</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes that seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>have considered a myriad matters. She sighed&mdash;she
stretched her arms in a yearning gesture in
the dim gulf of the world into which the wood
seemed to have turned. “It is away to London!
Maybe I shall never again see you nor Somerville
nor Montjoy, who is too good now to be seen
close, nor Middle Forest High Street that I
danced in when I was a little girl, nor my house
that I liked, though often was I wretched in it!
Nor my garden that the old wall mothered, nor
river that I listened to and listened to. Well, tide
and time we run away! But where we run to,
that is a question for a wise man! They say
that we run to heaven or to hell&mdash;and I shouldn’t
dare say my road was the first!”</p>

<p>Without warning Thomas Bettany found himself
priest. “If you’ve strayed into wrong road,
turn and take the other! You’ve got more than
you think of the other in you now. Turn, Morgen!”
He regarded her with a sudden startled
face. “By the rood! It’s the Great Adventure.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with more of the thorn in
her face than the bloom. From beyond an oak
came John Cobb’s warning voice. “Some one’s
coming! Two or three!”</p>

<p>“Go at once!” said Morgen Fay, and so meant
it that she wrought their going. Bettany, obeying
her, rode without turning his head, straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>through the wood. The trees fell like fountains
between the two and the thorn bush. To the right
lay the ruined farm, but they pushed on and came
after a mile to the narrow, little travelled road
that led at last to the highway that, passing Silver
Cross, ran on to Middle Forest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> turned his face from the wall to which it
had been set. Light was in the cell. He turned
his body; he rose. “Oh, my Lady&mdash;”</p>

<p>In the torrent rush of feeling he came close
before he kneeled. The light-swathed form
stepped back from him. He knew overwhelming,
aching, bursting sense of felicity that yet was
pain, was hunger. The float of the red and blue
drapery, the face that was the face of the picture,
the height, the sense of heaven in one Form&mdash;</p>

<p>On his knees he came nearer. His eyes were
not hidden as before, waiting for her to speak.
He could not other; he did not think at all. He
would have put hands about her feet and with his
eyes drink power and beauty and love.</p>

<p>She went back from him again. Something
untoward happened. Her foot and shoulder
struck the great rood, pushed slightly forward
from the wall. It spun aside. Behind it showed
in plain light a low and narrow doorway, with
door swinging outward, closed and hidden, all
times but this, by the great cross. Light showed
the very rope and pulley by which the masking
wood was pushed forward and drawn back. Light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>showed through into Brother Norbert’s cell; in
the very opening showed Brother Norbert and
over his shoulder the white face of Brother Anselm.
While Richard Englefield rose to his feet,
the shape that he had esteemed of glory turned,
bent itself and vanished through the opening.
Light went out.</p>

<p>There was an effort to close the door but before
it could be done his knee and shoulder were there
to prevent. There was a sound of breathing, of
muttering, then a hurry of feet. He broke
through into Brother Norbert’s cell and felt that
it was empty.</p>

<p>There was still a flickering light. It came from
a great, thick candle, almost a torch of wax,
thrown into a corner but not yet extinguished.
He caught it up and the flame sprang whole
again. It showed him much of apparatus. There
was the yet unclosed opening above, reached by
a short ladder, through which the shaft of light
had been sent into his cell. There were other
things,&mdash;tools, cords, bits of candle, cloths, what
not. Mind light blazed. He saw why the cells
had been emptied of old occupants; he saw that
these openings had been made while he was at
Middle Forest, he saw that they had used the
great rood for mask. A mantle lay upon the
floor,&mdash;red, with blue and red linings. He lifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>it and saw that it was earthly cloth, though fine
and thin. He saw the jointed wires that could be
stretched by the hand and so the tissues be made
to seem to float. He saw that they had put upon
him a cheat. He dropped the mantle but kept
the torch in hand. The door of the cell giving
upon stone passage was swinging open. He burst
through, he ran down the passage. This way
would have gone the whole complex monster, to
be overtaken and slain in fury. He ran, smoke
and flame streaming behind him, but at the bend
of passage came upon half a dozen monks. Of
these, four seemed just awakened. But Brother
Norbert and Brother Anselm were wildly awake.
He threw down the torch, he closed with
Brother Norbert. “Alas! Brother Richard!
You are mad! Help!”</p>

<p>Brother William that was a giant fell upon
him. They pinned him down. The sub-prior appeared
with two or three more at his heels. “O
Our Lady! Hath he gone mad!” He fought
with them all. “Robbers of souls!” he shouted.
They haled him into refectory that was near-by.
One ran for Brother Walter the leech. But
Brother Norbert and Brother Anselm vanished in
the direction of the cell he had left. “You are
cheats and murderers!” he cried, to the true
bewilderment of three or four. Brother William,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>at a nod from the sub-prior, thrust cloth into his
mouth, wound and tied the gag. Brother Walter
came. “What is wrong? What is wrong?
Doth he rave? They do so oft after so much
hath come to them!” He was haled down the
passage to the cell he had left. All was quiet
there, ordered, still, plain monk’s cell, lighted only
by the lights they brought. The opening was
closed and the great rood in place. When he
made to attack it, push it aside, they cried out in
horror and the sub-prior ordered his arms tied.
Finally, perhaps because he had ceased to struggle
and seemed to be collecting his wits, and a
madman with wits was notoriously dangerous,
they bound him with a rope to the window stanchions
and went off to put his case before the
Abbot. Brother Walter the leech would have
stayed, but the sub-prior sharply forbade. He
seemed to hesitate whether or no to leave Brother
Norbert but at last signed him forth. The rope
was strong, the man was quiet. Let him be till
council was taken! Solitude and none to hear
was regimen, time out of mind, for mad monk!</p>

<p>They went. The cell was like a tomb, and he
bound in it. It was dark, with a faint sense of
morning in the air.</p>

<p>Despite all weakening Richard Englefield was
yet strong of body. And he had rage that came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>like a giant to possess him, and a will that was
now gathered, collected, and hurled through space
to one point. He broke the cord that bound his
arms. This done he could free himself from the
gag and unknot at last the rope that bound him
to the stanchions. It was now to break stanchion
and cross bar and clear the window. He did this.
He climbed through the window, held by his
hands, dropped to earth. It had been impossible
to the sub-prior or to Brother Norbert, but it
was not impossible to him. It was all done
quickly. Stone rang beneath his feet. Light
shone in the Abbot’s house. Doubtless all were
gathered there,&mdash;the thieves and murderers!
Where was that one, that painted fiend, who had
given him cap and bells to wear through life?
Through life&mdash;through eternity! The church
rose dark. He looked at the stars above it, and
they seemed to him sparks from a mean and
smoky fire. Now he was at Silver Cross outer
wall. He climbed it and came down upon the
other side with cuts and bruises that he did not
feel. A palest light shone in the east. Behind
him, over him, he heard the bell for lauds. He
knew where ran the highway down Wander vale
to Middle Forest. He went straight like a wild
wind blowing down. All since he had waked
was done as it were in one moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Middle Forest it was market morning, high
May weather and many abroad. Country folk,
town folk, folk from across river made a humming
and buzzing in High Street and the market
place. The sun was an hour up, and all thrifty
marketers out of house. Saint Ethelred’s bells
rang, the Carmelites’, the Poor Clares’. Father
Edmund walked about; there were two of
Leofric’s friars from over river. May sun struck
the castle, up the steep hill from market. The
bells stopped. Eyes, thoughts, turned this way
and that.</p>

<p>A Silver Cross monk sped like an arrow
through the market place. He was at town cross,
on the lower step, on the upper step. He faced
around. “Middle Forest! Ho, Middle Forest!”</p>

<p>They recognized him. All the countryside,
flocking now to Silver Cross church, had sought
with their eyes for Brother Richard. Near or at
distance, he had been pointed out to many. A
cry arose and spread. “The monk of Silver
Cross!” Those close at hand came closer; those
afar hastened to the thickening centre. He
flung his arms out and up. He seemed to appeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>to Middle Forest, but also to high heaven,&mdash;or
he seemed to threaten high heaven. His voice
rang and reached like Montjoy’s trumpets. He
told what he had to tell, and all those ears drank
it in and all those eyes stared and mouths gaped.
He had power, and now it was power at the top
of its straining. As he told, what he told they
believed.</p>

<p>He paused, gasping, his face working. From
the step beside him sprang forth another voice,
that of Father Edmund, master-preacher and
scourge of the vices of the time. “Who alone,
in all earth around us, would dare so to blacken
the Mother of God, the Bride of Heaven? Have
I not cried that she was never gone but hidden
hereabouts&mdash;the harlot and sorceress, Morgen
Fay!”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield heard. He knew not the
name or its associations, but his mind leaped
fiercely upon it. Mind leapt like a famished wolf.
Then, straight up from a dark well, rose memory
of a chance-heard talk among the coarser sort,
in the Brothers’ common room,&mdash;talk of Middle
Forest from which one had come. That day he
had risen and gone away and stopped his ears
with work. So she was Morgen Fay, the harlot!</p>

<p>Enormous commotion rose around him. There
ran and jangled a multitude of voices. Impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to Middle Forest to forego the present sensation!
But the good and glory now flowing from
Silver Cross! Equally impossible to question
and forego that! Out of it all burst finally the
great cry, “Is there no Blessed Well, no Cavern
of Our Lady, no Rose in reliquary? But we
know there are the healed! Here’s one was
healed! The monk is mad!” Came like a bolt
from Saint Ethelred’s porch one whom all knew,&mdash;Friar
Martin, the Black Friar. He, too, stood
on town cross steps,&mdash;and half Middle Forest
was here! The Black Friar’s eyes gleamed and
that which gleamed in them was love of the glory
of Saint Leofric. Out poured the bull voice.
“The healed? They will stay healed! They
need not fear! Their faith in good made them&mdash;makes
them whole! What! The stars are
above the tavern lights! But here, verily, hath
been tavern lights, pothouse lights. But healing!
You shall not lack healing while stands Saint
Leofric!”</p>

<p>The place was grown like an angered hive.
Father Edmund and Friar Martin were a pair to
change bewilderment into passion. Father Edmund
hunted sin calling itself Morgen Fay. The
Black Friar had a pointing finger for the leper
spot in Silver Cross. Middle Forest grew to
sound of forest in tempest. So much swayed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Father Edmund, so much went with Saint Leofric
over Silver Cross, so much beat against
the two, asserting Silver Cross’s total innocence,
save maybe for a monk’s deceit and madness!
So many held purely for self and sought out the
profit. Market place grew pandemonium.</p>

<p>Out came a strong citizen voice, Master
Eustace Bettany’s. “Have Brother Richard up
to the castle! Let Montjoy hear!”</p>

<p>It was a channel and brought relief of pouring
into channel. Hands were upon the monk to
urge him. “Montjoy! Yes, tell Montjoy!”</p>

<p>The castle hill was sunny, the castle gate was
dim, the castle court sunny, the castle hall dim.
So many folk buzzed on castle road, below wall;
so many were let into court and buzzed there, so
many entered hall. From castle hill, if you looked
Silver Cross way, you might see rapidly moving
dust, growing larger, coming nearer. That was
Abbot Mark and Prior Matthew.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Montjoy</span>&mdash;yes, Montjoy!</p>

<p>A house that he had loved came down about
Montjoy’s ears. A garden that he had tended
the swine rooted up. One came and threw filth
against his Love.</p>

<p>He seemed to understand this monk and the
monk to understand him. For an instant they
were brothers in suffering and rage.</p>

<p>Sow it with salt&mdash;Silver Cross!</p>

<p>Abbot Mark and Prior Matthew. Who best
to send to cardinal and to Rome on that business?
Procure their degradation! Have them cursed
with bell, book and candle!</p>

<p>The whore&mdash;let her be burned slowly until
she was ashes!</p>

<p><em>O Isabel&mdash;Isabel&mdash;Isabel!</em></p>

<p>O Kingdom of Heaven that hath suffered
wrong!</p>

<p>Montjoy sat with a working face. He sat in
his great chair on the dais in castle hall and his
hands gripped the arms of the chair. At last he
spoke with voice of one underground who has
fire still but has lost the light of day. “Well, as
for thee, monk&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>“Give me, no more, that name!” cried the
man addressed. “The monk is dead. I am
Richard Englefield, the Smith!”</p>

<p>At that moment entered bruit of the arrival of
Abbot and Prior. “Yes, yes, let us see them!”
said Montjoy, and who knows what hope sprang
up in his heart. He believed Richard Englefield,
but there pressed against his belief all the weight
of old, loved Silver Cross, and the weight of the
priest and the weight of Mother Church. Things
happened, vile things, as they happened in Kingdom,
in Nobility and Knighthood. But for all
that Knighthood was heroic and Holy Church
holy. Child could not go against mother, lover
against beloved. Let us at any rate hear what
this Iscariot Abbot and Prior shall say! And
with that rolled for the first time upon Montjoy’s
mind Saint Leofric, and he heard the joy of
Hugh who was not discovered. “That this vileness
that he saith were not true!” cried Montjoy
within. “O Isabel, that it were not true!”</p>

<p><em>Morgen Fay!</em> The Lord of Montjoy was dead
ember there, and all the breathing of Morgen Fay
might not relume. “O High God, I would live
cleanly! That harlot, wherever she is, doth always
only evil!”</p>

<p>Silver Cross&mdash;Silver Cross! The church,
Isabel’s tomb and the great picture. He saw that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Morgen Fay could have played it because she had
the height and faintly, faintly the face. Isabel
was the true likeness and Morgen Fay the false,
the evil. “Let her burn, who deserveth it if ever
any did!”</p>

<p>Silver Cross, and cold wretchedness and grinning,
mocking Satan if it were no better than
Saint Leofric! Mark a kinsman, too. All honour
smirched!</p>

<p>Again his eyes were for Richard Englefield.
To have believed that Heaven had singled you
out&mdash;to have had vast raptures of mind and
heart, all fragrance, all flavour, all light, all music,
all warmth, all lifting&mdash;to have fallen at the
feet of the Brightest Star, to have had the honey
of touch and the honey of word and the honey of
smile, and knowledge that all was immortal and
holy, all was heavenly true!&mdash;to have had that
and believed it eternal&mdash;and then to have fallen,
fallen, gulf upon gulf, dreary world by dreary
world, to last mire and stubble, nay, past that into
caverns of hell&mdash;</p>

<p>Abbot Mark came into the hall, he and Prior
Matthew, and behind them Brothers Anselm and
Norbert with Walter the leech and six besides.
Out of these monks five at least knew only that
the fiend had made sortie against and taken and
poured madness upon the holy man, yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>the pride, the boast, of Silver Cross. Abbot
Mark&mdash;large, authoritative, stately&mdash;showed
pallor indeed, but also concern and innocency and
high unawareness that Silver Cross did or could
stand in any danger. As for Prior Matthew, he
stood and moved, red, dry, cool, collected, always
a man with a head. Abbey monks, drawing together,
looked trustingly upon their Superiors
and pityingly, it was seen, upon Brother Richard,
standing very gaunt and ghastly white, with
blazing eyes.</p>

<p>Montjoy faced that entry. All Silver Cross
with long venerableness and power, great church
of Silver Cross, the jewel windows, the picture,
the sculptured Isabel upon her tomb entered also
castle hall and drowned it into vaster space and
into significances otherwise and potent. Something
of rigidity went out of the lord of Montjoy.
Trust&mdash;trust!</p>

<p>Friar Martin, the Black Friar, saw it go&mdash;clouds
again mounting against Saint Leofric.
And all the hall full of people, hanging divided in
wish and thought! He felt it running through,
“Was it not monstrous, unthinkable&mdash;were
there not explanations&mdash;was it reasonable now&mdash;and
if it was all a cheating show, where was
Middle Forest? Why, left holding a great bag
of Loss!” The Black Friar felt, as though he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>were Leofric’s Hugh, stricture about the heart.
Good Chance was quitting, the fickle jade!</p>

<p>Yet when Montjoy stepped toward the Abbot,
pale Accusation stepped with him. “Lord Abbot&mdash;Lord
Abbot, you are in time! You have
fouled Christendom&mdash;oh, if you have fouled
Christendom!”</p>

<p>But the Abbot seemed not to notice words and
mien. He cried, “O Montjoy, the holy man,
good Brother Richard, hath gone mad! Yesterday
he broke into a frightful babbling, the fiend at
his ear, the fiends within him! The morn,
Walter the leech leaving him awhile, thinking
that loneliness might do somewhat, he burst window,
broke cloister! Whereupon we ourselves
follow him, not knowing what harm he doth to
himself and to all! For alas! he now doubteth
the happening of the Great Miracle and clamoureth
that it was the demon. We know, alas! how
at times it happeneth! Overmuch light, the
weak soul bending aside from Heaven-grace, the
fiends gathering to torment and perplex, and
were it possible, to defeat light! The warder
faints. Madness enters. Poor soul, alas! yet
Heaven did use him! Heaven-grace and the
miracle persists, though for him be madman’s
cell&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stood, father Abbot, in his large face godly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>concern for all awryness. He loomed. All Silver
Cross seemed with him, Silver Cross through
the centuries. Three fourths in the hall turned
that way. “He crieth otherwise,” said Montjoy,
and with a gesture set Brother Richard and
his Superior face to face.</p>

<p>Cried Richard Englefield, “Thou shameless,
false shepherd! Thou lying Abbot of a rotted
fold!”</p>

<p>At which a young monk, Brother Wilfrid, so
forgot himself, defending good, shaming ill, that
he rushed against the mad monk. “Son!”
thundered the Abbot and brought Brother Wilfrid
to his knees, crying, “Pardon!”</p>

<p>Truly Richard Englefield maddened. He saw
how it would end, and the legion before him. His
vision swam and darkened, light foam came about
his lips. He sent out a loud, hoarse and broken
voice. “Fraud! Fraud! Lord of Montjoy,
come to Silver Cross and see!”</p>

<p>The Black Friar, straining forward with the
rest, caught at that word, “Fraud!” He did
not dare to echo it aloud, for now, in a moment
as it were, many a hundred year of Silver Cross,
many a goodly deed and use penetrated, reverberated
here, large space entering somehow small
space, riving it apart. Old authority, long veneration,
the great Abbey church, Montjoy’s love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>for it, Middle Forest’s clinging to it&mdash;Friar
Martin had thundered one misty afternoon
against Montjoy’s doubting of Saint Leofric.
Montjoy had had to down head and slink homeward.
Now Friar Martin wished to shout,
“Fraud! Fraud!” and, “It began in envy of
Saint Leofric his great glory!” But he was
afraid. There might be no proof. If the monk
were not already mad he would soon be so.</p>

<p>Prior Matthew of Westforest moved a
piece. Still, conclusive, calming, entered his
voice. “It is seldom well to take madman’s advice!
But here it seemeth to me well. Lord of
Montjoy, you cannot do better than to ride with
us to Silver Cross.”</p>

<p>Lean and strong, and a master chess player, he
came to front of the dais, and lifting voice, entered
into explanation of Brother Richard’s sad
illness and of the ways of the fiend who for this
time had overthrown the saintly man. But he
would recover&mdash;Prior Matthew had no doubt
of it&mdash;under Walter the leech’s care, amid his
brethren at Silver Cross, or at Westforest, where
was smaller range, stricter solitude. He should
have tendance; he should have prayers. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>“As for
that Presence that did descend upon him. She
the Blessed is not harmed! Men and women of
Middle Forest, the Rose still rests in reliquary,
the Healing Well still heals! Let them that are
sick come prove it!”</p>

<p>Edmund the Preacher cried out mightily. “If
it be so, still hath the devil compacted with the
harlot, Morgen Fay! How else could the
thought of her, the form of her, enter here?
The devil made her to be seen in monastery cell,
thrusting aside True Queen! Seek her out, bind
her to the stake by town cross and burn her!
Never else will this countryside be cleansed!”</p>

<p>Prior Matthew looked with narrowed eyes.
“There is truth in what you say, Edmund the
Preacher! Long hath she been great scandal!”
He thought, “Best that she have her cry quickly
and be done with it! All the poison out at once
in one dish, not trailing forever, word here and
word there! She set sail, long ago, to come to
this end. This year or next, what matter?”</p>

<p>And he saw that it would make diversion. Let
her clamour what she would of what she had
done! It would be the fiend speaking. Silver
Cross and Matthew of Westforest against a mad
monk and a harlot!</p>

<p>Silver Cross and Westforest and Montjoy.
He saw as in a scroll that Montjoy would never
wholly believe nor yet wholly disbelieve.</p>

<p>Richard Englefield cried again, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>“Ride at once,
Montjoy! They will have burned ladder and
ropes and cloaks and scarfs. But the door behind
the rood&mdash;they have not had time there&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is that? What?” cried the Abbot
sharply. “Door behind rood?”</p>

<p>“Where was none, door was made between my
cell and yonder villain monk’s! So you sent me
for penance to Westforest, so it was done. Then
a great rood, great and black, was set before it.
Yea, you used Christ on the cross for mask!
Dim was it in that cell&mdash;never had I light in that
cell! Now I have light&mdash;now it burns! Aside
she pushed salvation&mdash;in she stepped, mincing
like a harlot, having taken sugar for her
voice&mdash;”</p>

<p>Abbot Mark fairly shrieked with horror. “Oh,
if we did not know that it is Sathanas himself
that speaketh, not the poor man whom he hath
laid in bonds! Door&mdash;door!” He summoned
sub-prior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reverend father, door truly was made, it
being once plan to take the wall down wholly,
making of two cells one and using it for an infirmary.
Then it was found that the light was not
good, and the plan was abandoned. Stone was
set back in the opening, and true it is that a rood
being about that time placed in each cell, it was
fastened, in this man’s and in Brother Norbert’s,
against that wall. Of all his story it is the only
truth! In his madness he must have torn the
rood aside and seen that once there was opening,
though now stone-filled and mortared. After
that what Sathanas saith to him God forbid that
we should know or repeat!”</p>

<p>“Shall I believe?” whispered Montjoy.
“Shall I not believe? O Isabel&mdash;O Lady near
whom moveth Isabel&mdash;”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield towered. He stretched his
arms, he raised his face. “O Christ, if thou be
true&mdash;O Blissful One, Eternal Virgin, if thou
be real&mdash;”</p>

<p>But summer sun shone on.</p>

<p>It was Prior Matthew who summed up and delivered
judgment in Montjoy’s hall. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>“Ride with
us now to Silver Cross, Montjoy&mdash;and do you
come also, Edmund the Preacher, and you, Master
Eustace Bettany, and any and all others who
will! Yea, make throng and procession!
What! Shall there be division between Silver
Cross and Middle Forest who have dwelled together
since the Confessor’s day? Sometimes
eh, Middle Forest?&mdash;we have quarrelled, but
not for long, have we? Ours, after all, one bed
and one hearth! Doth Silver Cross grow rich
and great, it is for Middle Forest. Doth Middle
Forest increase, Silver Cross goes smiling. Remember
the saintly abbot&mdash;Abbot Robert&mdash;and
how did he and his monks when befell the Plague!
Remember war, and we stood together. And now
Heaven blesseth both, and Holy Well, a thousand
years from now, shall still be Holy Well!”</p>

<p>He had it now&mdash;Mark and he had it in their
four hands! If they carried it carefully, and
they would do so, four hands obeying the Prior
of Westforest’s head. Now for the trouble
maker, the crazed one who failed to see or hear
Interest though she shouted at him and pulled
him by the robe! Prior Matthew gave a short
order to Silver Cross monks. “Take him!”</p>

<p>Brother Norbert, Brother Anselm, Brother
Wilfrid and the others fell upon Brother Richard.
Short, hard struggle, and they had him.
Brother Norbert bound his arms with hempen
girdle. As he still shouted accusations, at the
Prior’s nod they gagged him. “Not holy man who
may be holy man again, but Apollyon who now
hath seized the tower and speaketh from the
gate!”</p>

<p>Montjoy sat in his lord’s chair and looked
straight before him. Truth, truth&mdash;is it not
profoundly likely to be here? Were it not for
Hugh of Saint Leofric, could ever he have
doubted it? The monk’s tale,&mdash;fantastic, like
a romaunt! Say, darkly, it is true; what other
can cry Aye! and strengthen it, or No! and dash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>it into dreams? <em>Who other but Morgen Fay?</em></p>

<p>It formed in Montjoy’s mind that that harlot
must be found.</p>

<p>Prior Matthew, Brother Richard silenced, had
present eyes for the Black Friar there to one
side, standing grimly for Saint Leofric. “Now
and here!” said within the Westforest chess
player. Matthew spoke in his dry, reasonable
voice.</p>

<p>“Ride you, too, with us, Friar Martin! You
shall have mule. What! Saint Leofric and
Saint Willebrod, be sure they ride together!
Shall we not make England and Christendom ring
for that all this corner of earth, this side river,
that side river, Silver Cross and Saint Leofric
alike are blessed? Bridge over river shall be
to you and be to us, and I see it built thick and
high with booths and rooms for pilgrims! The
Princess of Spain goes to-day to Saint Leofric’s
tomb, to-morrow to Holy Well! To-day the
Dauphin heareth mass in Silver Cross, to-morrow
goeth in procession around Saint Leofric
his church! Both ways he passeth through Middle
Forest. Common good&mdash;common good!
What else is worth anything in this life? The
more massive the bruit, the broader, higher,
shooteth the fame of all!”</p>

<p>It was undeniable! Black Friar thought somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
surlily, “If I go I can at least take account
of all to Prior Hugh. And there is something
in ‘If you can’t increase apart, increase together’!”</p>

<p>Rested that fanatic, Father Edmund the
Preacher. Better always have Father Edmund
preach for you, not against you! He could any
time whip calm sea into storm. The chess player
considered him, to whom just now Morgen Fay,
the harlot, stood for all harlotry, whether of
brain or heart. When all heinousness was believed
of Morgen Fay, then would the countryside
be roused at last, then would every man,
woman and child become huntsman! Father
Edmund meant to continue to believe Brother
Richard’s story. Why not? She was capable
of it. Certain abbeys of this later time were
capable. Father Edmund was one to cry under
the Pope’s great window, “Reform! Reform!”</p>

<p>Prior Matthew saw the weather thickening.
Presently from that quarter lightning flash and
thunder clap! “Boldness my wisdom!” he
breathed.</p>

<p>His dry voice, somehow powder red like his
hair and tint, dry, rarely loud but procuring attention,
continued to hold all ears. “As to the
harlot, Morgen Fay, would you have my mind?
It is quite likely she be hidden somewhere within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>five leagues. Now Sathanas worketh underground
and taketh evil mind to evil mind, or often
to weak mind, or to mind that was Sathanas’
enemy against whom he useth every springe!
So to my thought it hath been here. Heaven permitteth&mdash;yes,
to try faith, Heaven permitteth!
The fiend works what seemeth victory, good man
turning toward him. Whom doth he use? Yea,
there is it! Harlot consenting, he yesternight
taketh her image and with it entereth neither by
door nor window cell of Brother Richard; yea,
entereth his mind and his eye and his ear, his will,
his belief and his heart. Brother Richard
thinketh, ‘It is the great True Pearl!’ And
falleth upon his knees before empty air, for the
devil fixeth images within, not without. But the
devil gives never for proof Holy Well that healeth
a score a week! And the devil hath had only
yesternight. Yea, moreover, midway Heaven
sendeth some aid and he that hath been holy man
seeth that it is not she who came before, but
stained wax and that the devil cheateth him!
Whereat the devil, that harlot no doubt still aiding,
leapeth, greatly angered, upon his mind,
teareth and bruiseth it tiger-wise and bringeth
it for this time into huge confusion and madness.
Again Heaven suffereth it, and suffereth him to
cry and accuse as madmen ever cry and accuse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>that by trial of our faith we may all be brought
clearer. But Heaven willeth always that we defeat
the fiend and his instruments. Aye, search
for these and grind them small and so grieve and
weaken that Evil One who rides invisible!”</p>

<p>Father Edmund cried. “She said, ‘Aye, aye!’
or the devil could not use her! Lord of Montjoy,
town of Middle Forest, Abbey of Silver
Cross, Priory of Westforest and Priory of Saint
Leofric, I, Edmund the Preacher, summon you by
souls’ welfare to join search for the Plague-spot,
the Witch-mark! When she is burned then may
the monk recover his mind, then may the True
Pearl, the Very Rose, show again, the toad be
banished from the Holy Well, Saint Leofric and
Saint Willebrod be sworn brothers, Montjoy give
again with joy to Silver Cross, Middle Forest
prosper, and all England and the Princess of
Spain and the Dauphin come in pilgrimage!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="17">XVII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> upon his knees he had come most close
to her, when she felt his hands, his brow, his
breathing against her sandalled feet, she had
given back in a kind of terror. Then, all unluckiness!</p>

<p>Flying, she had dropped her mantle. Brother
Norbert, Brother Anselm and their terrified
white faces! Brother Anselm coming after her,
out of the cell, down the stone passage. Another
coming after, great torch in his hand, smoke and
flame streaming backward his face like Death and
Judgment! Brother Anselm’s breathing on her
cheek, his hand seizing, pushing her, who needed
no urging, for now she knew panic.</p>

<p>The outward-giving porter’s cell that they
used&mdash;the door, quick! Through, clap it to
behind, draw bolt across&mdash;opposite door, quick!
Short passage again, the little postern. Anselm
had the key, Brother Edward the porter sleeping
elsewhere this night. Open&mdash;open! Morgen
Fay knew agony until she saw the stars over
Abbey orchard.</p>

<p>Wall and the ivy tods which made no ladder
necessary. Up! and on wide wall-top rest a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
breathe and look back. Bell was ringing,
lights hurried here, hurried there in Abbey, but
the orchard between lay still, at peace and bathed
in moonlight. Down the wall on forest side,
where footholds had been cunningly made.
Brother Anselm spoke. “I will work them over
so that even they cannot be found.”</p>

<p>“Through the poplar wood there is a path,”
she said. “Go back, and I will run alone to the
ruined farm. Never&mdash;never&mdash;never more,
Morgen Fay!”</p>

<p>They spoke in whispers. “Aye, it is better.
God knoweth what trouble we shall have now!
But you, mistress, you will be dumb?”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye! All night, on pallet, under eaves,
in the ruined farm, I was stretched so fast asleep!
I dreamed only of my house by the river and my
garden where now are blooming pinks and marigold!”</p>

<p>“Better that than dream of red flame!” said
Anselm. “Haste now!”</p>

<p>He slipped back over the wall; she was in poplar
wood.</p>

<p>The moon shone so that she could find her way.
Thin wood gave into deep wood, beech, oak. Her
feet felt the slight path. A doe and fawn started
from her, hare bounded across, owl hooted, moon
shone and light was beaten by branch and leaf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>into thousands and thousands of silver pieces.
She ran; she felt drunken.</p>

<p>There was near a league to go. Her pace
slowed, she stood drawing hard breath, then went
on again but not running. None were after her;
she heard none after her. Here clung darkness,
or cold, mysterious, shifting light. The air hung
cool, very still, with faint fragrances. Her mind
had wings, great dark ones, and now it beat in
the passages and cells of Silver Cross, and now
at the ruined farm, and now about and through
Somerville Hall. It went also to Middle Forest
and into Montjoy’s castle. Back it beat to the
ruined farm, and Somerville to-morrow, in this
wood, and then London road. London road!
No doubt now. London road! Her mind
sought London town, but that hung distasted,
weary, drear and threatening. “O Morgen, why
so? Will there not be Montjoys and Somervilles
there&mdash;aye, greater ones. Mayhap princely
ones!” But she hated London road and London
town. “Oh, what are the hands that hold
me here&mdash;cannot hold but would hold!” To-morrow,
to-morrow, next day at latest, London
road, London road!</p>

<p>Going through the dark wood, she no longer
felt panic. Perhaps it was so and perhaps it
was not so that all Silver Cross was roused, those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>who knew and those who did not know. She
knew that not twenty there did know; and at
first she had felt the hands of all those others,
the guiltless, upon her, against her. Almost she
had felt their stoning. But those who knew were
foxes and serpents,&mdash;cunning, cunning! They
would provide safety for themselves and so for
her, too, bound in the same bundle with them.
“With the foxes and serpents,” she thought.</p>

<p>Now she walked steadily, about her mighty
trees, overhead the moon, in her ears the million
small forest tongues, in her nostril the smell of
fern. The night did not terrify her, she was
warm in her frieze cloak. She saw the ruined
farm sunk in dimness and sleep. By the outside
stair she would creep up to her room, Joan the
serving-woman, so negligible a soul. To-morrow
would come Somerville. Morgen Fay, so
negligible a soul.</p>

<p>A voice went through her. “Who neglecteth?
Soul, soul, who neglecteth?”</p>

<p>She would not answer. She ran again under
the moon, upon the forest path.</p>

<p>Forest broke away. The ruined farm all in the
moonlight and Margery and David sleeping like
the long dead. The long dead&mdash;the long dead.
“Am I the long dead?”</p>

<p>She crept up the stair and as she did so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>cock was crowing. Here was loft chamber, here
straw bed cleanly covered. Frieze cloak dropped,
her body stood in moonlight, dressed in the colours
and the fashion of the great picture. Morgen
Fay took off the raiment and folded it and
laid it upon the bench under the window. “As
soon as it is light I will burn it.” She felt fatigue,
overpowering, extreme, and dropped upon
the bed and drew over her the cover and hid her
face from the moonlight in her arms, in her
hair.</p>

<p>But at first light she stood up. One might not
sleep this morning, not yet! She put on her dress
of serving-woman, took up the raiment from the
bench, made it into a small bundle, covered it
with her frieze cloak and went down the stair.
Margrey and David stirred in their part of the
house. She heard them talking, the woman
screaming to the man who was deaf. A tall,
blooming lilac stood by the beehives. Here she
hid her bundle, went and returned with a brand
from the hearth, shielded in an earthenware
pitcher. Taking it up again, she bore all away
from the house into stony field. Thorn trees
springing up presently hid her and her ways
from the house. Here, in a corner was a flat,
hearth-like space. She gathered dead twigs, took
her brand from the pitcher and made fire. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>opened the bundle and piece by piece burned all,
then with a thorn bough scattered the ashes.
Mantle and veil had been left in Norbert’s cell.
“Fire there, too, last night,” she thought.
“Hiding fire, cleansing fire.”</p>

<p>At the house door Margery cried to her, “Have
you baked the cakes and drawn the ale? Or
have you been to Fairies’ Hill? There’s a
witched look about you!”</p>

<p>She worked an hour and then another while
Margery watched and grumbled, then when the
old woman’s back was turned away she slipped.
“Joan! Joan!” But she was gone to wood
of beech and oak and ash. Somerville must come
soon, oh, no doubt of it!</p>

<p>Oak and beech and ash wore the freshest
green. Underneath spread grasses and flowers.
The sun came down in a golden dust, birds sang,
bees hummed, air held still and fine. She sat
and nursed her knees, or turning stretched fair
body of Morgen Fay on summer earth. He did
not come, Somerville did not come. So weary
was she that she slept for a while. Waking, she
found the sun at noon. She must go back to the
house and hear if anything had been heard.
Nothing! it might as well have been in dreamland,
a thousand, thousand leagues from Wander
side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>She sat at the table with David and Margery,
drank ale and broke bread. The two quarrelled
weakly, faded leaves on the edge of winter. She
felt suddenly that it was so with all things. As
though it were the greatest cloud that ever she
had met or had dreamed, as though it were night
that made other nights light, blackness rolled
over her. She rose, pushed back her stool and
quit the house. Certes, the sun shone. It made
no difference; she was night, night! Her feet
took her to the wood, anywhere, anywhere! She
must have movement. But night, night, and
horror of the spirit. She groaned, she flung
herself down under an oak and pressed her forehead
to its great root. She was leaf that had
left the tree, whirling down.</p>

<p>Blackness, emptiness, nothingness&mdash;but not
peace, no! The end, Morgen Fay, the end, the
end!</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she swooned, and that
then she came again. Now there was evil grey,
but grey.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she put out her hand and
that it closed upon a robe. It seemed to her that
she put her forehead to this. She said,
“Mother!” It seemed to her that hands came
down to her and touched her, that there was a
breathing, that a voice said, “O Thyself!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>She lay against trees in darkness and in ache.</p>

<p>Somerville found her here. “Asleep? Art
asleep?”</p>

<p>She sat up. “No. Awake. I have done a
villain thing.”</p>

<p>He regarded her with his odd, twitching face,
somewhat pale to-day, and the smile a dry
grimace. “If thou hast so, thou art like to pay
for it! All came out. Your monk broke cloister
and told it at town cross.”</p>

<p>“Yea, did he? He has manhood.”</p>

<p>“There was all town to hear. Father Edmund
tossed thy name forth like a ball.”</p>

<p>She moistened her lips. “So?”</p>

<p>“Then the monk told it in castle hall. Montjoy
believed.”</p>

<p>“Believed it of me? Well, I did it.”</p>

<p>“Then arrive Abbot Mark and Prior Matthew,
riding hard from Silver Cross. Now comes
about the strangest thing. I doff my cap, I lout
my knee to Westforest!”</p>

<p>He told. She drew hard breath, then broke
into terrible laughter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>“So, the monk is in the
madhouse and they drive a stake for me by town
cross? But the Abbot and the Prior and the
crew that worked for them, and Sir Robert
Somerville&mdash;oh, have you no little penance at
all? Must be that you are to say a hundred paternosters
or give a tall wax candle! Nothing?
Scot free? If they take me, I will tell!”</p>

<p>“If you do, it does you no good nor them
any harm! Prior Matthew usually spins without
a fault.”</p>

<p>“‘Us,’ Rob! Does ‘us’ no harm!”</p>

<p>He jerked his shoulders. “‘Us’ then. I was
at home. Thomas Bettany brought me all this
two hours agone. I came as soon as I could think
it out. Search is up already, Morgen! They
course here and they course there. Presently the
ruined farm. I run high danger, standing talking
here.”</p>

<p>“Begone, then! Quick, Rob, quick!”</p>

<p>Somerville turned red under her tone. “Naturally,
I am all thy care! Thou bitter witch!”</p>

<p>“Didst ever burn thy finger? It is not pleasant
to burn finger. Well, now, counsel!”</p>

<p>“Counsel is to hide as deep and as soon as may
be.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I thought of those thick alders by Wander
brook&mdash;a mile of them. If you lie close to the
ground, and they have not dogs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dogs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>“If search sweeps over, not finding, then to-night
a wagon filled with straw will cross Wander
brook at the old bridge, going Londonward.
This is all that I can do. I do no more, by all
the Saints!”</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “I do not after all wish
thee to burn beside me! Alders by Wander
brook.”</p>

<p>He said, “Hark!” raising his hand.</p>

<p>They heard it, distant rout of voices. “Go!”
he said. “Run! No time for love-parting! I
must return to the Hall.”</p>

<p>“I wish no love-parting!” she answered.
“That is dead. But farewell&mdash;farewell, Rob!
Now you go to the Hall but I to Wander brook.”</p>

<p>He was listening. “They come louder!”
When he turned his head, she was gone. He saw
her brown dress beyond ash stem and bough; now
she was deep in fern. He heard her movement,
then silence. Still a brown gleam, then that
vanished. He stood still, he put hands to face
and drew a breath deep and long, then turning
he walked rapidly through the forest to his park
and his hall. The ruined farm he had already
visited. David and Margery had their word.
“A serving-wench? Yes, they had had one&mdash;Joan.
Country from toward Minchester. But
she was gone&mdash;a se’ennight since.” Somerville
had climbed the steps into the loft room. Little
was here of Joan or Morgen Fay. But what was,
he himself had carried and given to hearth flame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>There was one thing, a rose tree in a great crock,
and this most carefully he had destroyed.</p>

<p>Now, walking fast toward Somerville Hall, he
thought, “Have you done wickedly, knight?
Why, not so wickedly! A little here, a little
there, but no great amount anywhere. Even
chance, they may not beat the alders.” He made
for himself a picture of London and a little house
by the Thames, and Robert Somerville coming
to its door, it opening and Ailsa saying, “Why,
enter, knight! Flowers and candles and
wine&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morgen Fay crouched among rushes, beneath
alders at the edge of a wide brook. It was still
and sunny, warm, the water singing drowsily.
Two dragon flies in blue mail. The reeds met
over her head; it was still as creation dawn. A
trout leaped, clouds sailed overhead, blue sky
returned, vast, shining, deep as forever. A butterfly
and the dragon flies, a small tortoise among
reeds, a blackbird in the alders,&mdash;stillness, stillness,
sun, remoteness. Her muscles relaxed.
She thought, “Oh, after all&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then came the voices. She cowered, lay flat,
looking only with terror to see if she made chasm
in the reeds. They waved above her. “Oh, perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;”
She prayed. Then she
heard the dogs, and they opened cry. She heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>a shout, “They’ve got her!” and as they came
with great bounds she rose from among the reeds.
She would have run, but could not. She raised
her voice, “Call off the dogs, and I will come to
you!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Said</span> Master Eustace Bettany to Thomas Bettany,
his son:</p>

<p>“Idle&mdash;thou art idle! Hadst as well be in the
new Indies as in my countinghouse! Paper costs&mdash;and
there thou goest scrawling, scrawling, and
never a sum adding nor thinking out market!”
He snatched the whitey-brown sheet. “Waste
makes want! What are you scribbling there?
‘I saw it in a flash&mdash;I saw it in a flash!’ What
is it, prithee, that you saw in a flash?”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany rubbed his eyes. “That the
world’s a great merchant, father, selling herself
to herself and buying herself from herself.”</p>

<p>The elder glanced suspiciously. “Will you be
turning monk?”</p>

<p>“No, though I think there be good monks, good
abbots and good priors.”</p>

<p>“Of course there be good monks, good abbots
and good priors! God forbid that you go believing
witch’s story and mad monk’s tale!”</p>

<p>“What would happen if I did, father?”</p>

<p>“Madman’s whip and bread and water and a
chain! Go to, Thomas, what is wrong?” Suspicion
sat in his eyes. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>“That’s a new thought
and one I like not! Were you among the
reachers for flowers that grew by harlot house?
Were you?”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany shook his head. “I’ve told
you I wanted Cecily.” He rose from chair and
desk. “Eh, father, also I would like a ship that
sails and sails away&mdash;with me, and Cecily! Now
let me be going, for I told Martin Adamson that I
would come myself for his monies.”</p>

<p>“Aye? Then go&mdash;and do you remember,
Thomas, that you’re all the son I have, and that
I have been good to you!”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany went afoot through Middle
Forest. “‘All the son I have, and I have been
good to you.’ ‘<em>All the life I have and I would
not burn. All the life I have and I would not
burn.</em>’ That’s Morgen Fay in prison yonder.”</p>

<p>The day was hot with a cloud drawing over.
Hot and still with a green light. Folk in the
street looked upward. “Rain coming!”
Thomas Bettany meant to go to the house of
the debtor. But there was no hurry. It was a
long day. Long day and short day. “Prison
day must be long day, O Saint John, long day!
But short day, seeing that it pulleth and hasteth
toward death day&mdash;Friday. And now it is
Monday.”</p>

<p>Fascination drew him by the town cross. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>would not set stake and fagot till Thursday.
“How doth it feel when the iron hoop goes round?
How doth the heart strive and choke when the
torch comes to the straw? I feel it in myself!
Doth Somerville feel it in himself? Doth Montjoy?”</p>

<p>Persons spoke to him in the market square. He
was young and big and gay and well liked. He
answered enough to the point, and went on; and
now here was the prison, tall and black among
ruinous, ancient, steep-roofed houses, set under
the castle hill with tower and wall above, and
over these and all that slate sky with greenish
light. Deep archway and iron door and men
lounging. He went by Morgen Fay alone in the
dark, and he knew that what she had told to
burgher and lord and churchman was true&mdash;he
had seen it in a flash&mdash;and a terrible and wicked
act had she done, meriting hell where she would
burn forever! But then, Somerville, but then
the Abbot and the Prior?</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany, who had owned a young,
clean, gay heart, perceived that the world had
taken plague.</p>

<p>He wandered. He would not go home, nor yet
to the debtor’s house. Rain held off, but the sky
was covered, the light green, the air still and hot.
He went down to the river. The bridge,&mdash;there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>were pilgrims upon it, a double line of them,
chanting, coming from Saint Leofric. To-morrow
they would go to Silver Cross, and Holy
Well would heal one at least, maybe two or three.</p>

<p>It made no difference what the monk of Silver
Cross had cried nor what Morgen Fay. Was
healing then within one’s own mind and heart?
Was there the Holy Well?</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany went down the watersteps,
found boatmen and their craft and hired a row-boat
for an hour. He would row himself.
“Storm coming, master!” “Aye.” “If it
were Friday now, it might put out fire, and that
would be sore pity! Saint Christopher knoweth
the boats on this river that have rowed to Morgen
Fay’s house! Well, it used to be a fair sight,
her window and her garden, and all the time she
was witch and devil’s paramour! They do say
Montjoy will walk barefoot to Canterbury because
in old times he was her fere!”</p>

<p>Bettany rowed away. “She is a human being.
Say it, and I think that you say all.”</p>

<p>River, river, and houses standing up, and on
the other side willows. “River, I wish you would
drown fire. Fire is good where it should be, but
at times it acheth to be drowned. And then again
water acheth for the fire.”</p>

<p>He rowed with long, slow strokes. Houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>went by under the dull sky and they seemed to
look with menace. “That only can truly help
that hath not been truly harmed. That, too, I
see,” said Thomas Bettany, “in a flash.”</p>

<p>A house by an old wall, brooding to it. Small
houses and small garden. The garden was
turned wilderness. He caught colours that might
be flowers, but the weeds were thick and
high. A window&mdash;and casement slowly turning
outward. All the garden trim, but shrouded in
mist, the houses shrouded in autumn mist, the
river&mdash;and Morgen Fay looking out.</p>

<p>Rowing away fast from that he shot up river
and then to the other side, and beneath willows
shipped oars and sat head on hands, thinking
first how all impossible it was, and then, very
wretchedly of Somerville.</p>

<p>Sky darkened still further. With a long sigh,
he took up his oars and rowed slowly back to the
bridge. Going up the water steps he had it now
in mind to ride, storm over, to Somerville Hall.
It did not need, for in High Street he came upon
Somerville on his big bay horse. Somerville saw
him and waited until he crossed to bridle. “Aye,
Thomas?”</p>

<p>“I was going to ride to the Hall. Where can
we speak together?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come to the Maid and Garland. And look
more blithe! The Turks have not entered England.”</p>

<p>The Maid and Garland had a parlour for Sir
Robert&mdash;oh, always! They went into a little
panelled room, and Somerville turned upon the
younger man, the burgher’s son. “Well?”</p>

<p>“I saw it in a flash.”</p>

<p>“Saw what?”</p>

<p>“Much, Somerville! You held Morgen Fay
in your hand there at the ruined farm. Plotters
to become as great at least as Saint Leofric could
not have gotten at her, she could not have joined
with them without your knowing! Oh, and I
saw, too, that land that you got at last without
trouble, after years and years of trouble!”</p>

<p>“Let me alone!” said Somerville hoarsely.
“You young fool!”</p>

<p>“From all that I can hear she has not said
your name, not once! It was of her own movement,
once Abbey and Priory would promise her
safety and London town and gold. ‘Thou monstrous
witch! Thou daughter of the Father of
Lies!’ crieth Silver Cross and Westforest and
Middle Forest; aye, even, I hear now, Saint
Leofric. But for all that, Robert&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Robert’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir Robert Somerville. But for all that I
know, I think, where most lying lies. Save for
the Great Lie that she acted and made, and wicked
it was to do it! But if she is the wicked one,
who else beside? And though she be made of
evil is she to burn without a word, who says no
word herself?”</p>

<p>Somerville answered him. “Are you mad?
What do you mean? When they stoned her out
of town I made it possible for her to hide at the
ruined farm. I am badly repaid, and I close my
mouth, and if they ask me there I will lie to them,
pardie! Put her at the ruined farm, not I! But
who asketh? It is enough that she be pure Satan
with Satan. Witch found here, why easily found
there! Who believes but what they wish to believe?
Who can save her from her burning?
God, perhaps, if He chose to do it!”</p>

<p>“Then I will go pray,” said Thomas Bettany.
“I was not her lover.”</p>

<p>“Psha!” said Somerville. “She was a common
lover.”</p>

<p>The young merchant turned red. “Only great
fright could make you say that, Somerville!”</p>

<p>“Were you noble,” answered Somerville, “I
would take that up. As it is, let us be better
strangers.”</p>

<p>“That bargain is made, merchant with ‘Sir’
to your name!”</p>

<p>Somerville opened the parlour door. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>“Reckoning,
host&mdash;and a cup of sack!” When the
younger man had gone, as he did go immediately,
he turned back to the room to sit at table with
his wine and wait out the storm which had now
come pelting. Dusk was the air and a chill wind
came in at crevices. A boy arrived to lay and
kindle a fire. The flames reddened the room.
Somerville, hand around cup, sat and watched
them.</p>

<p>Storm over, he left the Maid and Garland,
mounted his big bay and rode out of town.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="19">XIX</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as might be, Montjoy would go that
pilgrimage to Canterbury. Had it been true,
that frightful story, were Mark and Westforest
treacherous, Silver Cross down in the mire,
evened and more than evened with Hugh across
the river, he would have gone not to Canterbury
only, but to Rome, to Palestine! Only there, in
Gethsemane garden&mdash;</p>

<p>He sat, a slight, dark man with a worn, handsome
face, beneath a cedar in his castle garden.
This was lord’s corner. A castle, God wot, is a
public place! But just here was retirement, appropriated
long since and possessed for long.
Wall and ivy and cedar row, and hardly a narrow
window to overlook! Montjoy once had been
quick for company, but now for long he sighed toward
solitariness. Solitariness that still should be
splendour!</p>

<p>Silver Cross&mdash;Silver Cross&mdash;Silver Cross!
The splendour must run through it, bathing the
tomb of Isabel, bathing the life-above-death of
Isabel! Bathing also Silver Cross, church and
abbey, the old form, antique, fair, one’s Lady, old
yet young through the centuries!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>The soul. How to keep the soul in joy? If
not in joy, at least in humble peace.</p>

<p>Montjoy saw himself a grey palmer, state and
place laid down. His daughter wedded come
Martinmas to Effingham&mdash;another year and her
son born&mdash;then he might go and have word
with his own suzerain. Palmer&mdash;the road, the
shrines, the houses of the religious; quiet, quiet,
unobstructed room for dreams of God.</p>

<p>The sky was lead, the light greenish, the air
hot and still. He would be glad when the storm
burst and the land was drenched. Afterward it
would smile once more. He thought, “The Flood
is needed again, so wicked is the earth! Oh, my
God, am I of the family of Noah? Do I build
with gopher wood the Ark that saves? Do I
enter Christ? Doth He enter me?”</p>

<p>The cedars clung dark, they darkened the day
yet more. Montjoy looked into a cell at Westforest
and saw there Richard Englefield. Surely
he is mad, though he lies so still, with his face
buried in his arms!</p>

<p><em>Brother Richard.</em></p>

<p>Montjoy looked into the prison under the castle
hill and saw Morgen Fay.</p>

<p><em>Not for five years have I touched her, O
Christ!</em></p>

<p>The prison closed. The sky hung so still and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>hung so heavy! Lightning and thunder would
be welcome, rising wind and splash of rain. Friday
would be welcome. The bramble burned, the
hindering, evil bramble, harmful to the sheep,
vexful to the shepherd&mdash;“O Christ, is there
hardness? But the field must be cleared of
bramble. Aye, it is worse than bramble. Mandrake
and hemlock and helebore, and the children
are endangered!”</p>

<p>Montjoy saw Holy Well and the great picture,
and that fine, fine reliquary of pure gold that rejoicing&mdash;Satan
afar and all the mind in health&mdash;Brother
Richard had wrought for the Rose,
Montjoy bringing the gold. Yesterday Montjoy
had gone to Silver Cross and to Holy Well. There
had been pilgrims a hundred, and they kneeled,
praying and singing. The day was fair as this
was foul, and had bubbled and laughed that crystal
well, sunlight into sunlight! They had cups
of silver and of horn and of tree and of clay,
and one by one they drank while the singing rose
around. He, Montjoy, had seen a cripple fling
away his crutch and stand and run, and a palsied
man grow firm. “Who healeth them? Thou,
thou, who truly didst appear to Brother Richard!”</p>

<p>Even now, in this oppressive day, under this
dull sky, Montjoy felt again that exaltation. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>looked around him and up to the lowering
heaven. “Little, weak castle&mdash;murky roof of
ignorance&mdash;yet is there clear power!”</p>

<p>The rain began to fall.</p>

<p>In the night-time, waking, he found horror
with him, something cold, something forlorn and
suspicious. It deepened. He left his great bed
and Montjoy’s wife sleeping, put thick gown
around him and went noiseless into the oratory
opening from the great chamber, cold in the
beams of a moon growing old. No peace! At
the turn of the night, when afar he heard cock
crow and his dogs bark, he determined that he
would go that morning to confession to Father
Edmund at Saint Ethelred’s. That was the sternest,
the most dedicated, the most single of eye and
will! To him he would confess everything that
he would if he could save from her death the harlot
and witch.</p>

<p>Morning came and all the castle took up busy
and talkative life. Montjoy rode to Saint Ethelred’s.
Father Edmund? Oh, aye! he would
hear him, and Father Edmund thought. “Time
that lords give over slothful and unwise confessors!
Father Ambrosius hath forever done
him hurt.”</p>

<p>Montjoy was long upon his knees. He accepted
heavy penance, took shrift humbly, came forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>from Saint Ethelred’s with a colourless face like
a gem.</p>

<p>Riding back to the castle, when he came to
prison street he turned his black horse and rode
slowly by the dark prison. He had told Father
Edmund all his thoughts and in the bale was the
thought, “I will visit her there in that dungeon
before Friday. Is not that Christian, O God, if
my deepest heart that is now thine seems to bid
me to go?” But Father Edmund had been
greatly stern. “Satan wrestleth for thy deepest
heart! Hear me now! It is forbidden! Go
not to, speak not to that All-Evil! If thou dost
she will draw thee with her into hell! Thou
thinkest, ‘Once I was familiarly with her’, and
cowardice and heartlessness now only to think
and never to say, ‘God have mercy upon thee,
poor soul!’ Son, son, that is devil’s bait! He
will come and stand and ask thee, ‘Is it
knightly?’ It is his wile, to clothe himself in
light! As for the witch, she lacks not soul counsel!
Since she was taken, each day have I
preached to her. I will hold the cross before her
chained to stake. She shall see it, lifted high, till
flame takes eyes. But thou, my son, I lay it upon
thee, leaving here, to ride by the prison, and to
say as thou ridest. ‘Sin, I will no longer sin with
thee, nor come into thy company!’ Say it!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>“Sin, I will no longer sin with thee, nor come
into thy company.”</p>

<p>“So! And son, thou wilt come with thy
squires and thy men on Friday to town cross.”</p>

<p>So Montjoy rode by the prison.</p>

<p>It was dark in there, fetid and dark, and Morgen
Fay the sinner had little to think of but her
sins. She could not blink them that they were
many.</p>

<p>Her sins and death, and after that the Judgment.
Death and Judgment and for her Hell,
or at the best the direst corner of dire Purgatory
and the longest stay. Ages there, while souls
of thieves and murderers left her one by one and
went upward, and never a word for the one who
must stay. At the best, the very best, and perhaps
even that gleam had no reality! Not Purgatory,
but everlasting Hell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="20">XX</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Englefield</span>, in Westforest cell,
might lie without movement, head buried in arms,
but that was when he must sleep in order to gain
and keep strength, or when Prior or Brother
Anselm visited him, it being posture good as
another for a monk now in sooth going melancholy
mad.</p>

<p>Once Brother Anselm, who had been taken
from strollers playing in barns and inns, said
to the Prior, “He playeth!” Whereupon the
Prior strictly watched, but at last said, “Not so.
Truth!” And then, like such chess masters, because
he had bent what he thought all his mind
to it and was assured, he obstinated in his opinion
of the board and every piece upon it. “No, it is
truth! I have seen it before. Melancholy that
forgets how to speak and then after a time mere
childishness that will not stint from speaking,
though it be only of green fields and cowslip
balls! Then silence again like an old sick hound
and at last he dies!”</p>

<p>Brother Anselm’s doubt had been but momentary.
He agreed now with Prior. Also he said,
“One helpeth forth the sick hound.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>The Prior of Westforest took his lean chin
from his lean hand. “I have heard that the
Greeks writ over their temples, ‘Nothing too
much.’ Where the good of all is in question let
the soul take necessary burdens, but not unnecessary
ones! This were unnecessary.”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield was not going melancholy
mad, though he played that he was. He worked.
He worked while he lay still upon the cold floor,
face hidden by stretched arms, or when he sat
moveless, staring into naught with empty, woe-begone
face. “Think me melancholy mad, do!
So the sooner will you leave me the cell!” They
went. For hours he had the dim place to himself,
and at night he had it.</p>

<p>Monk of Silver Cross was gone, whirled away
to the dark country behind Chaos and there dead
and buried peacefully. Here was Richard Englefield
the master goldsmith. And yet not that
either. Here was one who had risen behind goldsmith
and monk, who had come up like a tree that
was not suspected.</p>

<p>He worked, Richard the smith. He gained, no
man knew how, two bits of iron. The cell was
grated. He filed through a bar and then another,
and in the night-time broke the whole away. Fortune
or wonder or the miraculous or some natural
air into which he had broken was with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>It might have been the last, his will was so
awakened, so in action. His fury towered, but it
was still fury, very deep and dangerous, bitter
passion of a man with mind and will. He saw
Success and drew her to him as giants draw. In
the dead night he got away.</p>

<p>Westforest formed but a small House and it
lay close to Wander. Stripping off his robe he
made it into a bundle and with rope girdle tied
it upon his shoulders. Then, naked, he plunged
into the Wander and swam a mile downstream.
Coming to the bank he rested, then swam the second
mile, under the late risen moon. Cocks were
crowing. He passed grey meadow and dreaming
corn and came to a forest where it overhung the
Wander. “Here is good place to leave!” He
quit the water, shook his body and dried it with
fern, untied and unrolled monk’s gown and put
it on. “Brother Richard? Nay, monk is as
will is! Richard Englefield, a smith in gold and
silver!”</p>

<p>He was away now from Wander, in the forest,
the morn pink above the trees, violet among and
beneath the branches. In yonder direction lay
Silver Cross and not so far, neither. Middle
Forest! Could he get, unmarked, to Middle
Forest. Had he one friend there&mdash;but he had
none. Could he get to the shipping upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>river, below the bridge. Could he find a boat that
would take him to the sea and then he cared not
where! He saw Success. “Aye, I will!” But
this robe must somehow be changed for world-dress,
and he must have a purse and money in it.
Hard to manage! But Success was his Moorish
slave and would bring them.</p>

<p>He strode on. He was going toward the town
through what was left of the ancient, all-covering
forest. Hereabouts was yet a great wood with
deer and hare and bird and fox. Paths ran
through but between them spread bounteously the
forest. First light gave way to gold light. He
was hungry. He took the crust of bread that he
had saved from yesterday and ate it as he walked.
Also he found strawberries. When the sun was
well up he came to rest under an oak, to think it
out.</p>

<p>He had some hope that Westforest would
hold that he had drowned himself. Yesterday
had been a hot and livid day, ending in storm.
They would be able to trace him to the water
edge. Would they drag the Wander, seeing that
the Prior must wish to make sure? But the
Wander running swiftly might carry him down.
Using Prior Matthew’s eyes he saw monk
caught among stones on Wander bottom, or, a
log, shoved down Wander length to greater river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>and so at last to sea, white bones for merman’s
children. He thought with Prior’s brain, “So,
it is very well!” And if Wander had him not,
but he strayed on dry land, Brother Richard of
Silver Cross, mad now though once greatly
blessed, there would ensue some trouble of taking
him, some explaining, but no more than that!
Richard Englefield saw the net, how strong and
wide it was, the fishers here being so much
mightier than the fish. So mighty were they
that they could spare the fish even if it leapt clear.
For if it went and told all other fish and fishermen,
what odds? Mind in all was made up what
to believe! Richard Englefield laughed, but his
laughter was worse to hear than had been sobbing.</p>

<p>He tried to make a plan, but it was hard to
plan out of this! Best still trust Success. He
took a pebble and tossed it, then followed it. Narrow
road little travelled. He walked upon this
some way and saw a horseman coming. Out of
track into a hazel brake, wait and see what like
he might be! Sun glinted, boughs waved, birds
sang, over all things lay a pearly moisture after
storm.</p>

<p>Young Thomas Bettany, riding from town
because town oppressed him, taking idle way and
ancient road because to-day bustle liked him not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>errandless and leaving John Cobb at home, rode
through the old forest with hanging head. He
would mend the world if he knew how, but he
did not know how.</p>

<p>Coming to brake his horse started aside.
Thomas crossed himself. A monk was standing
there, seemed to have stepped forth from it. “Is
it a ghost? By Saint John, Brother! you look it
and you do not look it!”</p>

<p>He knew him now, having seen him at Silver
Cross thrice, maybe, since the finding of Holy
Well. Thomas Bettany felt himself tremble a
little. <em>Brother Richard</em>&mdash;<em>if he were mad</em>&mdash;but
then he remembered himself that he was hardly
so! They said he was mad, an Abbot and a
Prior whose deeds might not be scanned.
Brother Richard! Though some were guilty the
monk was not. Again he saw things “in a
flash.” The monstrous disappointment&mdash;Heaven’s
boon companion, then fall&mdash;fall&mdash;fall!
How sharp the stones and black the land!</p>

<p>He spoke in a whisper. “Did you break last
night from Westforest?” All the countryside
knew that Brother Richard, now alas! utterly
mad, was to be hidden there in a grated cell.</p>

<p>Richard Englefield knew not why Success was
here. He said, “You know me then? Who are
you?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>“Thomas Bettany, merchant’s son.”</p>

<p>“I greatly need,” said the man by the hazels,
“burgher’s dress, a purse of money, and to reach
some ship in river that presently makes sail.”
Having spoken, he waited again upon Success.</p>

<p>“I shall have to ride to Middle Forest and
back,” said Thomas Bettany. “Over yonder
a mile lies a ruined farm. No one goes by wood
that way. Walk till you see the house through
trees, then lie close till I come.” Few words more
and he turned horse and presently disappeared
down the leafy road.</p>

<p>Englefield moved off into deep forest toward
the ruined farm. It was Success. It was of a
piece with breaking free from Priory. Maybe
there were gods who said, “Thou touchedst
nadir, now we let thee rise!” Maybe it was the
Will, so fulfilled and potent that it became magician.
Trust far enough, and the bird comes
flying! But not trust like that at Silver Cross&mdash;no!</p>

<p>Deep wood, beech and ash and oak, very silent,
very lonely. At last it thinned and he saw
through trees an old, small, ruinous farmhouse,
broken, neglected, haunted maybe. He made out
a man slowly working in a field. A grey horse
grazed, a cock crew, but there seemed no dog
to bark.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>He drew back under trees, found a bed of leaf
and moss and threw himself down. He was tired,
tired! Body was tired but not spirit. That
should not flag. No, no! said the will. But sleep&mdash;it
was necessary to sleep.</p>

<p>He did so for a time, but then he waked clearly
and suddenly. Where he had been in dreams he
did not know, nor where in the deep realm behind
dreams. But there had been large and happy stillness,
full ocean and serene sky. Whence&mdash;whence?
From heaven, and had he mounted
there, the True Ones pitying? From heaven’s
opposite? Then again had come upon him that
rapture that befell at Silver Cross&mdash;three
nights’ rapture&mdash;rapture at the feet of a harlot
of harlots! Evil had been the rapture through
and through, that had seemed so heavenly glorious,
heavenly sweet! Never to have guessed&mdash;never
to have known&mdash;to have been incapable of
knowledge! True and false alike to him, hideousness
and beauty alike, he who had thought he
knew beauty! Incapable&mdash;incapable. That
had seemed Success&mdash;oh, high Success!</p>

<p>The sun rode high and streamed in warmly.
He found shadow and lay upon his face, arms
outstretched along the earth, hands breaking
twigs with which the ground was strewn.</p>

<p>This part of earth looked full to sun, then glided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>from strongest vision, then took it obliquely, beginning
to think of cool, dark rest from it, filled
with memories. At three by country dials he
heard a horse brushing through the forest and
presently saw Bettany with merchant’s pack
strapped before him, not a pack large and noticeable,
but sufficing to show that the House of Bettany
attended to business and was not too proud
to attend in person.</p>

<p>At four by dial Richard Englefield stood under
the oak in good hosen, shoon, shirt and doublet,
with cap, with cloak, with leather belt and knife,
with leather purse and silver in it and hidden in
bosom pocket woollen purse with gold. Gaunt he
was as any wolf, and overcast with pallour, needing
days of sun and air to bring him back to what
he was a year ago in Silver Cross, or further back
to the gold-brown master smith not unknown in
cities and in princes’ courts. Just that smith
would never come back. This smith had himself
been laid upon a Vulcan’s anvil. The fire showed,
the hammer showed.</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany said, “Monk not again because
of them hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Not so. Because of myself.”</p>

<p>The other continued, “God wot there is not the
old saintliness! I have heard wise men cry that
unless there came reform God will loose lions.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>“Perhaps. But come as it may I am absolved
from monastery.”</p>

<p>“Abbot Mark and Prior Matthew be not everywhere.
There are good abbots, good, religious
houses&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, I doubt not. Even at Silver Cross and
Westforest are some true pilgrims and finders.
But I am absolved. Brother Richard lies
drowned in Wander. This is Richard Englefield,
a smith in gold and silver. But since it may not
be wisdom to say that till I reach London port
or maybe France, then Richard Dawn, a traveller.
What of ship?”</p>

<p>“It is the <i>Vineyard</i>, lying in the pool and sailing
day after to-morrow at dawn. The master,
a young man, Diccon Wright, is beholden to me.
I found him at the Golden Ship, and he will
do it.”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow at dawn.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing for it,” said Bettany, “but
that you should bide where you are through to-night
and to-morrow. Then at eve I will come
with a horse for you. Canst ride?”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye!”</p>

<p>“There is no moon. We make through country
to pool side and find there a boat that Diccon
sends. So the <i>Vineyard</i> and away.”</p>

<p>“You are good to me, brother!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>The other answered, “I somehow owe it. And
not to you only. But here only does it seem that
I can pay.”</p>

<p>He took from pack loaf of bread, pound of
cheese and a bottle of ale. “Here we be! Nay,
I have had dinner. Well, I will eat a little to
keep you in countenance, Master Dawn!”</p>

<p>They ate under the greenwood tree, close
screened around with thorn and fern. “It will
be cold to-night sleeping here. There is a loft
at the farm. The old man and woman dodder
and are blind and deaf. There is a straw bed.
But strange and elfin were it, I think,” said Bettany
slowly, “if you slept there.”</p>

<p>“In old years I have slept out colder nights
than this is like to be. And a cell is cold.”</p>

<p>“Well, the cloak is thick. Nay, drink! I may
have my fill when I get back to father’s house.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="21">XXI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun</span> came more and more slanting through the
trees. Eating was done. The two sat in forest
light and coolness, and they went over plans step
by step so that there might rest no misunderstanding
nor any happening unprovided against. “The
<i>Vineyard</i> boat, and the word is ‘<em>Gold and silver</em>.’
South around Middle Forest and then
east. Leave the ruined farm at dusk to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I have found a great hollow tree,” said
Englefield and pointed to it. “If any come, in I
creep!”</p>

<p>“Good! Unless there are dogs,” Bettany
said. With that he fell into silence.</p>

<p>The other, half-reclining, also was silent. Gold
light playing over him showed how gaunt he was
and his face how lined and smitten.</p>

<p>Bettany spoke. “Dost think True Religion
has taken any hurt?”</p>

<p>“How should True Religion take hurt, having
been all the time in another country?”</p>

<p>The young man mused. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>“To have thought
one’s self Chosen out of all the world because of
one’s qualities&mdash;and then to be thrown back, past
one’s old dwelling, past, past, down past the whole
world&mdash;”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield spoke. “I looked on
Medusa. Do you know what is that, to look on
Medusa? And looking, to open on the knowledge
that you yourself were the artist?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Thomas Bettany. “But the first
of it must have been glorious! Honey and kingship
and worship and safety for aye!”</p>

<p>“<em>Honey and kingship and worship and safety
for aye.</em> Just that! Then the hair turned to
snakes.”</p>

<p>Silence in the forest. Bettany moved a little.
“Friday. I suppose you are glad of Friday?”</p>

<p>“What happeneth Friday?”</p>

<p>“She burns at town cross. Morgen Fay.”</p>

<p>“<em>What have I to do with that?</em>”</p>

<p>Forest silence filled with tongues. Bettany untied
his horse and strapped the empty leathern
case before the saddle. He looked at the discarded
habit of monk of Silver Cross. “Put it
in the hollow tree?”</p>

<p>“No. In the deep sea to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Better in river. Then if ’tis found, as like
enough it may be, surely&mdash;all say&mdash;you were
drowned!”</p>

<p>He stood, bridle in hand. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>“Morgen Fay. She
had a house by the river and a fair, small garden.
Aye! she was harlot, but then what were Montjoy
and Somerville and others? It is a speckled
earth. There is other sale than that? Aye, she
made it, and bought blackness and flame and peril
maybe for ever and ever. Because she was harlot
and Father Edmund preached mightily just then
against her, they broke her house and garden and
stoned her forth from town. Then one that I
know who is speckled, too, hid her for a time.
Then, as fate or somewhat would have it,
came to Prior Matthew knowledge that she
had to certain eyes much of outward face and
form of the great picture, so that he who painted
might have set her before him for first model.
That knowledge and that she was still in Wander
vale. So all followed. She thought she was buying
ransom&mdash;safety if not honey. Once I saw
played at the Great Fair <i>Faustus and the Devil</i>.
Faustus thought he would buy happiness, and
here was to-day and perhaps would never come
to-morrow and death! So she thought. Safety
and perhaps house and garden once more, and
maybe to-day will last! But <em>thy soul is required
of thee</em>,&mdash;and she is in prison waiting.”</p>

<p>He mounted horse. “I will come ere sunset
to-morrow. When you hear <i>Otterbourne</i>
whistled, it is I.”</p>

<p>“Should something happen,” said Englefield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
“and all this go awry, still have you done for
me what if I had younger brother or dear comrade
or old fellow-worker with me in my craft, I
might have hoped for&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I do it, but I must do it.
For a time I thought of you five times a day as
most blessed. You were heaven’s courtier, you
were sailing on heaven’s ship! Now you are man
like me, though older than me, and I see you need
a friend. You thought you had so great a one&mdash;and
then there was blackness! I’m nothing but
Thomas Bettany, but I’ll set you at least on the
<i>Vineyard</i>. Let’s say no more!”</p>

<p>The merchant rode away. The master goldsmith
was left by the ruined farm in Wander
forest.</p>

<p>He saw the red orb of the sun descend past
boles of trees. It sank beneath the earth. All
the west hung fire red, then the colour faded.
“I will go now to sleep, and God knoweth I need
it! When I come to London, or rather, I think,
to France&mdash;”</p>

<p>Down he lay. Bettany’s cloak was thick, the
leaves and moss a pleasant bed, soft dusk around,
the forest a cradle with cradle song. “Sleep&mdash;sleep!
Sleep&mdash;sleep!”</p>

<p>But sleep was at the antipodes. “This place&mdash;what
is this place?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>“Bitter Shame, Very Anger, strengthen me!
Let me not pity the witch! Let me not feel her
misery mine! Let me not long to see her face,
touch her, hold her!”</p>

<p>“<em>Shall I desire the dragon that slew me?
Shall I cherish Medusa?</em> Burning&mdash;burning!”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and walked the wood,
up and down, up and down. He moved with disordered
steps, twigs and boughs striking him.
The long June day left still a radiance.</p>

<p>He threw himself down and lay with face
buried. Time dropped away, drop by drop, and
each drop a world and an æon.</p>

<p>Dark clear night, moonless but starlight.</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany, returning to Middle Forest,
found at his own door a ship’s boy sent by Diccon
Wright. The latter was again at the Golden
Ship and would see him there. He went and
found that the matter was that <i>Vineyard</i> boat
could not be at landing first planned. The <i>Alan-a-Dale</i>
had come in and chosen to drop anchor
just there. Best now the old landing by the reeds.
Bettany agreed. Old landing by the reeds.</p>

<p>Home again and preparing for bed he determined
to rise early and ride to the ruined farm.
If at dusk aught happened and he did not reach
the man nor tell him of where now he was to go&mdash;then
mischance enough! With a long sigh he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>put himself into his comfortable merchant’s bed
in comfortable merchant’s room. He slept and
waked, slept and waked and at last an hour before
dawn gave up sleeping and lay staring before
him. “Now it is Wednesday. To-morrow is
Thursday, and then Friday.”</p>

<p>Light stole into the chamber. He rose, moved
softly, dressed quietly, stole downstairs, unbarred
the small door and was out in court and across
to merchant’s stable. Here he saddled his horse,
Black Prince. East was daffodil; morning star
shone over the castle. Poor Clares’ bell rang
lauds, Black Prince went by the softer ways as
though velvet shod. So at peace was the land
that town gates were no longer closed at night.
The industrious young merchant riding through
rode off toward Wander forest.</p>

<p>Sun had risen when he came nigh to the ruined
farm and began to whistle “Otterbourne.”
Beech and ash and oak, fern and thorn, and by
a thorn tree he who had been, but was no more
Brother Richard. “Well, in these days, many
leave cloister&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

    <div class="p_line">‘But gae ye up to Otterbourne</div>

    <div class="p_line_i4">A fause knight ca’ ye me.’”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Thomas Bettany, dismounted now, looked with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>wonder at the other who stood tall and gold-brown
and determined. A night had made a
difference!</p>

<p>“You must have slept well under oaken tree!”</p>

<p>“No. I did not sleep.”</p>

<p>“Then faery queen must have visited you!
Truly you have the look of it!”</p>

<p>“I longed for your coming, fellow worker, and
that I should not have to wait for it till eve! Who
brought it about? Still that Success!”</p>

<p>“<i>Vineyard</i> boat cannot be at the landing I told
you of. It is now the old landing by the reeds.
It seemed best to let you know without delay.”</p>

<p>“Had you not come I might have stained my
face and gone into town, changing voice, changing
step and figure&mdash;Richard Dawn, traveller with
gold in his purse, sending from the inn to Master
Thomas Bettany&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think well that all the Folk in Green have
been here! It is such a place as they flock to.
Morgen Fay hid here at the ruined farm.”</p>

<p>“No! <em>She walked in this wood.</em>”</p>

<p>Green light and purple light and gold. Throstle
and finch and cuckoo, robin and lark. Fern up-growing,
wild plants in bloom, the wood a chalice
of odours, censer swinging. Englefield put his
hands to his temples. “Friday!”</p>

<p>“What is it, man?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>The other moved to a tree whose great roots
pushed above the soil. “Come sit here, younger
brother, and listen to me!”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany obeyed and he moved as one
in a dream, or as though the wood had grown a
magic wood. “You have become leader here.
Something has come to bloom and to fruit in you
in a night!”</p>

<p>“I shall not go upon the <i>Vineyard</i> unless there
go two.”</p>

<p>“Two?”</p>

<p>“Unless she that lies in prison goes.”</p>

<p>“Morgen Fay!”</p>

<p>“Aye. Morgen Fay&mdash;Morgen Fay.”</p>

<p>Bettany put hands to tree to steady himself.
“What is here?”</p>

<p>“Didst never read that man holds within himself
autumn, winter, spring and summer, the
moon, the earth, the sun and the four kingdoms?
Maybe the fifth, but we have not come to that
yet.”</p>

<p>“Friday.”</p>

<p>“Are you not willing that she should vanish
from them, cheating the cheaters? Friday.
Death in flame!”</p>

<p>“God, He knoweth. I think that she should
live!”</p>

<p>“Look at me!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>Thomas Bettany looked. Again he steadied
himself, he drew hard breath.</p>

<p>“How could you get her out of prison? It is
not to be done!”</p>

<p>“Then no ship takes me to-night or to-morrow
night! Friday. There will I be by town
cross!”</p>

<p>“Not in two days could you save her!”</p>

<p>“Suppose we try?”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany stared at an artist in daring.
This gold-worker had imaged, drawn and beaten
out many a bold pattern, many an intricate and
subtle. Now he said, “Come, deliver what material
you may! How lies prison within and without?
Who are there? Tell what you know.
We have to-day which is Wednesday and to-morrow
which is Thursday. The <i>Vineyard</i> must not
sail before cockcrow Friday.”</p>

<p>“I could not buy Diccon there! I might beg
him for love.”</p>

<p>“However you do it, you will do it. I see in
fine air within gross air a ship that weighs anchor
at dawn, Friday. Now, tell!”</p>

<p>Bettany described with minuteness that prison
and its economy. “I have a man, John Cobb.
His cousin Godfrey is gaoler.”</p>

<p>“So, thou seest!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>“But there is naught I know of that would
buy Godfrey. Keys might be melted in his hold
but he would not give them up! Town, castle
and Church know Godfrey.”</p>

<p>“Then let him not know that they are gone.”</p>

<p>“That is not possible.”</p>

<p>“It is possible, or I would not see the <i>Vineyard</i>
sailing Friday. Everything is possible save her
burning. Can your man sit with Godfrey, drinking
ale with him maybe, and come to handling
and fingering keys great and small, and questioning,
‘This is great door, this inner ward, and this
where she lies who burns a-Friday?’”</p>

<p>“So much as that is possible.”</p>

<p>Englefield, leaving him seated, staring, took
himself three turns between thorn and oak, by ash
and beach. The forest was gold, the day was
gold, the morrow gold and he the smith. He returned.
“Have you a piece of wax, fine and
smooth, such as might be held secretly in palm of
hand, softening just enough with heat of body?”</p>

<p>Bettany gave an abrupt small laugh. “I’ve
read of that in a book from the Italian! But if
John Cobb were bold enough and skilful enough
to take&mdash;Godfrey’s face being buried in tankard&mdash;impress
of keys, what then, beseech you, unless
you had all the fairies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sun is an hour high. If I could have that
mould here ere he rises again! But it must
be well done, well taken, with pains. Our keys
must turn in our locks.”</p>

<p>“In the greenwood? I know that Brother
Richard made wondrous things! But this were
to make wondrously!”</p>

<p>“I planned through the night&mdash;this plan, that
and the other. But this one is best. When the
moon rose and again at first dawn I went
softly about that house yonder. None saw nor
heard; they were sleeping. The man has burned
charcoal, and surely they have oven or hearth.
Gold in this purse may buy them, seeing they cannot
know whom I am nor what we do. You say
they are old and losing wit.”</p>

<p>“Furnace and fuel and print of keys in wax
and smith&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you bring me iron and the tools. I shall
show you.”</p>

<p>“Thou’rt a bold man!”</p>

<p>“Thou’rt another!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="22">XXII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> John Cobb but Thomas Bettany, who
knew whom here he could trust, sat on a Wednesday
afternoon in gaoler’s room, drank ale
with Godfrey and once more petitioned for one
look at the witch.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” said Godfrey and shook his
huge head. “Rule is rule! Time was I wouldn’t
ha’ minded pleasuring you, Master Thomas, but
word has come and a downright word, too, from
powers. ‘Look you, Godfrey, that you do not
open that door to any save Father Edmund who
preaches to witch so that it may not be said she
goes to hell without preaching!’ So I do not so.
You are not the first gallant who hath come and
said, ‘Godfrey, let me have a look at the witch!’
But no, says I to all. Rule is rule!” He set
down his can. “I could tell you, but I won’t. Not
just young will-o’-wisps like you, but one that’s
older and should be weightier! But I won’t call
name.”</p>

<p>“I can call it for you,” thought the other. “It
was Somerville.”</p>

<p>“Coming by night, too!” said Godfrey.</p>

<p>Young Master Thomas Bettany made a pettish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>movement. “Saint John! What’s the use of
carrying that great bunch of keys if you cannot
turn them at your will! Let me weigh them
now!”</p>

<p>Godfrey, smiling broadly, laid the bunch on
table. He was a giant, and Thomas Bettany had
been known to him since he was urchin and went
by to school. “Great key&mdash;inner ward&mdash;key
you turn on her?”</p>

<p>Godfrey nodded. “Eh, eh! She has been a
fair woman, has she not, and danced lightly?
Marsh fire, will-o’-wisp! Now she lies all her
length on cold ground, and when I open the door
she saith, ‘Is’t Friday?’”</p>

<p>“Hark ye! Some one’s knocking.”</p>

<p>Godfrey turned head. “It sounds as they
were!” Rising from table, he went to the door.
“Nay, only noise in the street.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was the other door.”</p>

<p>Godfrey stepped from the room and walked
a little way down the stone passage. He returned.
“‘Tis nothing! And William sits there to
answer.”</p>

<p>“If William wakes now how doth he keep
awake by door yonder at night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>“He gets sleep enough. Prowling around,
sometimes I find him sleeping when he should be
waking! But there be few in prison and little
trouble. In old times, when the kings were fighting
together, it was different!”</p>

<p>He took up the keys and fastened them at his
belt. “If any could bring witch to confession
you’d think it would be Father Edmund, wouldn’t
ye? But she’s like a block!”</p>

<p>“Confess what?”</p>

<p>“Just all the story of how the devil came to her
and she sold him her soul for ease and triumph.
But he’s not a bargain-keeper&mdash;never was!
And how he flew with her through air and stone
wall, and set her in Brother Richard’s cell, in
place of Queen of Heaven. What she said and
did, and how the devil, all of a sudden seeing that
heaven had struck Brother Richard with the
knowledge, ‘This is not the Queen, this is not the
true bright one!’ went about to confuse all
Brother Richard’s wits, turning him into worse
than Doubting Thomas, for now he doubts all
things both before and after. But she sticks to
saying, ‘It was I from the first, and the devil was
Prior Matthew, Abbot Mark consenting.’ And
Father Edmund preacheth again. Eh, but Friday
cometh and she will soon be but a story!
Morgen Fay and the devil.”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany rode once more with merchant’s
pack to Wander forest, having first gone
to Golden Ship by the water side, where he met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>Diccon Wright and bought him with love. It
was again rose dawn. To one who at edge of
town stopped and questioned him, he said that he
was riding to Somerville Hall.</p>

<p>“Do you not know Sir Robert has gone to
London? He rode away yesterday with three
behind him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye! But there was message left for me.
One day I’ll travel myself! View Rome and Constantinople
and Cambalu.”</p>

<p>“It’s in my mind that he did not wish to see
Morgen Fay burn.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so! I’d rather myself see fairies by
moonlight or a fair still garden.”</p>

<p>Ruined farm and David and Margery to whom
gentlemen were gentlemen, whatever strange
things they wished, and rose nobles were rose
nobles. “Oh, aye! Who is there for us to tattle
to save it be Dobbin and the cow? There’s naught
doing like that Joan who turned to be a witch
named Morgen? We might ha’ had trouble
there, but Somerville stepped in and turned it
aside. So you’ll ha’ to do, Master Bettany, if
there’s any mistaken doing here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, I will. But there’s none.”</p>

<p>This was a day of gold dust, still, warm, a haze
and floating stillness. Ruined farm and forest
hereabouts might have had a hedge around them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>like the palace of the Sleeping Beauty. No ears
heard fine smithwork, for Philemon and Baucis
were deaf, and went beside to planted field. The
fairies might have heard.</p>

<p>Mid-afternoon Thomas Bettany returned to
town. Near the old wall, now on the high road,
he overtook a string of pilgrims footweary and
dusty. The leader hailed him, handsome young
burgher riding a fine horse. “Canst tell us, master,
what inn is best for us?”</p>

<p>“Try the Joyful Mountain. Whence do you
come?”</p>

<p>From Minchester, it seemed. To Saint Leofric
and Silver Cross. “And we’ve just heard news
about a fearful witch and that she’ll be burned
to-morrow. We shall see that first. Thank ye,
and our blessing, master!”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany gave to his family the supper
hour and showed himself during it affectionate
son and brother. “Eh, Thomas!” thought the
old merchant, and like the pilgrims he, too, gave
him blessing, though an inner one.</p>

<p>Marian, his sister, who was a mouse for quietness,
said suddenly, “Oh, I would that to-morrow
were gone by! If I were Morgen Fay to-night&mdash;”</p>

<p>Master Eustace Bettany rated her. “Say
naught like that even in jest!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>“I was not jesting.”</p>

<p>“Thou’rt so far from Morgen Fay that thou
shalt not say, ‘If I were Morgen Fay&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“She is woman.”</p>

<p>“Witches have left womanhood. Be silent!”</p>

<p>Table was taken away. Eustace Bettany disappeared
through the door which led to countinghouse.
Marian came to Thomas in the deep window.
“Stay awhile, Thomas, and read with me
‘Romaunt of the Rose!’ Cousin hath sent us,
too, ‘The Grey Damsel and Sir Launfal.’”</p>

<p>But Thomas could not stay. He kissed her and
went forth into the sunset. By town cross they
were piling wood. Saint Ethelred’s bells rang.
The young man stood and prayed.</p>

<p>Dusk came over all like brooding wings. Stars
brightened above the castle. Up there Montjoy,
seated in his great chair, listened to Prior Matthew
of Westforest.</p>

<p>“Not to hear of it till now&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“It is not yet three nights ago, Montjoy. And
it seemed, and still seemeth best to seek quietly.
We have had, to my mind, too much indeed of
buzz and clatter! I wish for quiet to descend
upon us.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I also!” sighed Montjoy. “So the soul
may return to her proper work! But open&mdash;all
things should be open!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>“In reason, aye! But the world is idle and
will make scandal if it may.”</p>

<p>Montjoy pressed back of clasped hands over
eyes. “The world is thistle and precipice! I
have fearful dreams at night. Welcome will it
be to me, oh Christ, when I may go my pilgrimage!”
Rising from his chair he walked to and
fro, then returning to the table, laid touch upon
a great and splendidly bound book, fine work upon
fine parchment, illuminated head letters and
borders. He touched it reverently. “See you, so
beautifully done, two hundred years ago! Chronicle
of Silver Cross. I have been reading as I
have read a hundred times! Miracles then
a-plenty, and such goodness, such spiritual men,
that all seemed grown pure Nature! I thought
the gloss and freshness were all back, but I do
not know&mdash;I do not know&mdash;I do not know!”</p>

<p>Prior Matthew said quietly, “Until this madness
Brother Richard was a good and holy monk.
How else should Heaven have found him as glass
to shine through? And now if, as we think, he
lies drowned in Wander, it does not seem to us
self-murder. The mad are not accountable there.
Again, he may have slipped and fallen. So now
Our Lord may clear his mind, and his purgatory
done, he will again be wise and holy.”</p>

<p>“Purgatory lasteth long!” said Montjoy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>“Thistle and mire pit, thirsty desert, precipices!
And what if he did not drown but roams at large,
telling with flaming eyes and tolling voice and
large gesture his story of not one but many
Satans?”</p>

<p>“The whole region knows that he is mad.
Were he so abroad, how long before we should
have known it? Oh, we have questioners and
seekers out, but quietly! Hour by hour Wander
grows to us the more certain. Yesterday we
dragged, but the water runs swiftly and may have
carried him down.”</p>

<p>“Death. Well, who should tremble at that
unless he be sold to wickedness?”</p>

<p>Through open windows they heard compline
bell. “To-morrow draws on. There will be a
great concourse. Saint Leofric and Silver Cross
and Westforest, country folk and all the town,
seamen and pilgrims. And what to see? A
woman burning.”</p>

<p>The Prior spoke serenely, invisibly his hand
making final move, providing mate. “Nay,
Montjoy, Good vindicated, Ill consumed, Warning
spread!”</p>

<p>Thomas Bettany absented himself from Middle
Forest.</p>

<p>Dark night, clear and dark. Lights twinkled
in tall houses, lantern and torch twinkled and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>flared in narrow streets. Glowworm points from
those belated moved over the bridge. Night
deepened. Lights went out one by one, cluster
by cluster. Now there were great spaces of
naught between twinklers and flarers. Dark
space widened, twinklers and flarers growing
lonely, separated afar from one another. Ships
below the bridge had lanterns, but the ships were
few. Lights lessened, lessened, until you might
say Middle Forest was in darkness. Lanterns of
the watch went slowly about, but wary eye might
know where watch had been and where it was
now and where it would presently be. Cautious
foot might tread among the three. Of course,
if shout were raised, watch hearing it would come
running.</p>

<p>Midnight and after.</p>

<p>Godfrey had good wine to-night, brought him
by Master Thomas Bettany. Godfrey thought,
“Brought for present to soften me to let him look
at the witch!” He grinned and took the wine
but kept to “Rule is rule!” “Very fine Jerez
sack,” explained the young merchant, “out of a
lot bought in London. And will you give a stoup
to William and Diggory? Diggory is a great
fellow of his inches! I saw him Sunday wrestling
in long meadow.”</p>

<p>Godfrey drank the Jerez wine with his supper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>and he poured a great cup for William and for
Diggory. They drank. “Aye, aye! Bettany
knows how to choose the best!”</p>

<p>Deep night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="23">XXIII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Deep</span> night. Over the castle Pegasus, over
town southward the Eagle, walking down the
west the Ploughman, low in the southwest the
Scorpion, due south the Archer, on the meridian
the Lyre.</p>

<p>Deep night in prison. Morgen Fay waked.
“What use in sleeping? I shall do no work to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Memory. For some ease, take Memory by the
hand, but go with her into old countries, not into
those near at hand! She remembered a forest
like to Wander forest, and she remembered an
ocean with shells upon the beach. So cool the air,
and the water going over her, cool, cool and restful!
She remembered music.</p>

<p>Once a grey-beard begging friar had told her
that all things that ever were or are or can be
were but parts of music. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>“Listen, and you will
hear! Gather the notes and make them into
strains. Put the strains together&mdash;you will begin
to have a notion! When you have lived
long enough you will come to hear the strains
made of strains and how they combine. All the
jangle is imperfect music, music finding itself&mdash;”</p>

<p>Music. So it was all music? A long way to-night
to where you might see that!</p>

<p>Dancing. Once it had come to her herself,
watching sunbeams and some nodding, waving
trees and a long ripple over wheat, and feeling
a wind that kept measure, that dancing was somehow
a great and sweet idea of some great Gayheart.
“Shall I dance in prison and hear music,
and to-morrow flying this way?”</p>

<p>Love. What is that?</p>

<p>She thought. “I have never seen it. I know
it not. Perhaps for garden and Ailsa and little
white rose tree. Ah, yes! But I have loved my
way, and fire on my hearth and wine on my table.
Now I will have enough of fire, and there is a
wine they say of wrath. Love&mdash;love! What is
it, Morgen Fay? If there be such a country I
shall not see it. Where do you go to-morrow,
Morgen Fay, and what anguish in the going?”</p>

<p>“O God, O my God, make wider the little passage
between me and thee!”</p>

<p>So dark&mdash;so dark. Night and night and
night!</p>

<p>A little noise at the door, but not like Godfrey’s
hand. She sat up, being near the door, the place
was so small. Stealthily, stealthily, a sliding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>noise. She felt the door open and rose to her
knees. “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Friends! Don’t make any noise.” One
came in at the door and touched her. “Morgen,
it is Thomas Bettany. You are willing to follow
me? Then come at once.”</p>

<p>She rose and followed. The door was shut behind
her. The second man, stooping, turned the
key and withdrew it. A little way down the passage
with no more noise than moths&mdash;door of
inner ward&mdash;through it, too, turn key and take
out, find cross passage. The second man who
had not spoken held the least, small light. A
cresset, too, burned dimly, swinging from a beam.
A man lay sleeping by the wall,&mdash;Diggory, Godfrey’s
helper. It seemed that he was sleeping
soundly. A turn, a wider space, and the great
door and William sleeping upon a bench. Open,
great door. Light showed a chain and a staple
broken out of wall&mdash;open! Out of prison.
Starlight&mdash;the street&mdash;soft and swift like moth
and bat. Lanterns and footsteps of the watch.
Press into angle of Saint Ethelred’s porch and
cease to breathe while they go by! Avoid market
place, cross High Street, softly, swiftly; find
Saint Swithin’s Street, narrow, steeply descending
toward the river. River in the ears, and the
old disused water steps, and beside them a boat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Thomas Bettany’s voice saying, “<em>Gold and silver</em>,”
and the man in the boat answering, “<em>Gold
and silver in the Vineyard.</em> Step ye in!”</p>

<p>Down the river, and by the house of Morgen
Fay and into the widening of water that was
called the Pool.</p>

<p>There were but three men, Bettany and the
man with him and he who had held the boat and
who was called Diccon. The man who had opened
doors sat very silent. But so were all, saying
nothing, rowing silently. And Morgen Fay was
still, still! Oh, the divine night air and the stars
and the cool water, cool and singing! A ship
rose before them. It seemed they were going
there.</p>

<p>Thomas spoke to her. “Your name is Alice
now, not Morgen. Remember! Alice&mdash;Alice
Dawn. This ship is the <i>Vineyard</i> and it touches
at three ports. You will be safely put ashore,
and here is gold.” A purse slid into her lap.</p>

<p>Ecstacy of freedom, air and the stars. Alice&mdash;Alice
Dawn! She put her forehead upon her
knees and laughed. “Oh, all of you, what will
you <em>not</em> see to-morrow! Now you have your
miracle!”</p>

<p>The ship coming closer and closer, a tall ship
and making ready to sail. “Whither? And will
I find Ailsa?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>“I cannot tell as to that. Diccon Wright, the
master there, is a helpful man. And the Saints
are above us. I do not fully know,” said Thomas
under breath, “what I have done!”</p>

<p>The ship came near. “Ah, how dark it was in
prison! Thank you and bless you!”</p>

<p>Andromeda lay across the northeast, the Crown
was in the west, the Swan overhead. “Ship
oars,” said Diccon. “Here we are!”</p>

<p>“You quit me now, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Aye. I must be at home and in bed if there
come any calling!”</p>

<p>“Are you endangered?”</p>

<p>“No! They will call it again the devil. Where
all have tender hands he is the best one to pull the
nuts from the fire!”</p>

<p>“Good-by, then. I shall bless you every day
and it shall not hurt you!”</p>

<p>“I never thought that it would, Morgen Fay.”</p>

<p>“No. Thou’rt clean! Good-by, good-by,
good-by!”</p>

<p>The ship overhung them,&mdash;bowsprit and
carved sea goddess, body of ship and high forecastle,
masts, spars and rigging. And the stars
shone between, and men were up there making
sail among the stars, and all the air sang around
and the water sang. Morgen Fay had her own
courage. It was coming to her from far and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>near. She felt like a child. Something in her was
crumbling away, or something within her, after
long groping, was painfully lifting itself into
higher air. “<em>I have tasted evil, I have tasted
good; I like better the last taste.</em>”</p>

<p>The rowers ceased to row. A rope was flung,
a manner of ladder of rope slipped over the side.
Master of the <i>Vineyard</i> and Thomas Bettany
spoke low together, then the former mounted to
his ship. “Now, Alice Dawn&mdash;God bless
you!”</p>

<p>“God bless you.”</p>

<p>She was light and strong. She climbed, she
stood in the waist of the <i>Vineyard</i> and turning
herself, looked to see the boat put off with two.
But the rower who had not spoken, the man who
had been silent in street and lane, who had opened
doors silently in prison, was climbing from boat
to <i>Vineyard</i> deck. Light from a lantern by the
mast fell upon him. Burgher’s dress, cap of blue,
young beard of brown-gold upon his face.
“Where?&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>Bodily there rose before her the cell at Silver
Cross and all the sudden lights, coloured by some
old secret device, that bloomed about her and her
floating drapery, and this man upon his knees.
With a cry she turned to the boat. Two seamen
had descended in Diccon’s place. It was <i>Vineyard</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
boat, it would put Bettany ashore and return,
and no boatmen at the main water steps
have any tale to tell. Already the boat was away
from the ship. “Friend! friend!”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield stood beside her. “He cannot
return, nor help us further, Morgen!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="24">XXIV</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span> folk went up and down. Palace where
sat a strong king, Tower where traitors lay in
ward, wall maintained through the centuries upon
the base the Romans laid, Aldgate, Newgate,
Ludgate, Bishopsgate. London Bridge, London
Stone, Baynard Castle, old Temple without the
Templars, with the lawyers. Blackfriars, Whitefriars,
Greyfriars, Austin Friars, Crutched
Friars, crowd of monasteries and nunneries,
great buildings of stone, lesser buildings of
wood, churches and churches, and a good way
out of town Westminster, where the king
was building his great chapel with the wonderful
roof. Sixty thousand, maybe seventy
thousand people in London. Learned men were
there, artists were there, merchants there, men of
the Church, of the law, of the sword. Hidden
Wickliffites, hidden Lollards were there. Astrologers
and alchemists were there and men of the
rosy cross. Navigators and discoverers were
there, striving to show Henry what to do to balance
or counter Ferdinand of Spain and Emmanual
of Portugal. Mechanics and artisans were
there, many and many men of many crafts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>Guilds and guilds. London of the bells, of the
Wall and the Thames; London outer, London
inner.</p>

<p>Near the Old Jewry ran a narrow street where
dwelled many workers in metal&mdash;ironsmith, coppersmith,
silversmith, goldsmith&mdash;not the great
known workers but the lesser ones that the great
hired. A narrow street of poor houses, dark
and noisy, or dark and still. The children
were poured into the street, the women sat in the
doors or clacked up and down. From some
houses came always the clink of metal upon metal,
from others the workers went away to other
places of work. At night they returned. Now
the sun cleansed all, now the fog came dull-footed
into the street and the houses and stayed.</p>

<p>Jankin, a worker for an armourer, opened the
door of an old house. A large room, which was
a workshop, and four small rooms, and out of
the house had recently been carried a bier. The
man who died had been an old, independent metal
worker. Here still were his furnace and his tools.
Whatever had been his family it was gone; apprentices
who had dwelled with him were away
to other masters. “But his custom would come
back,” said Jankin. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>“The whole thing for so
many pounds. Something down, but the most
could be worked out. ’Tis said there’s a ghost
in the house, and so they don’t sell or rent it
easily.”</p>

<p>The man with him said, “I rent it and buy the
tools.”</p>

<p>Jankin answered, “If you do the work you used
to do, master, ’t will be like planting a tree in a
flowerpot!”</p>

<p>“No. And ‘master’ me no more, Jankin!”</p>

<p>“<em>Diccon Dawn.</em> It comes strange! But many
a man and a great man is in danger. Well, you
were never much in London, master, and you’re
changed. Eh, those days I was with you in
Paris! I hear them still between hammer
strokes, and they come around me like fairies.
And you’ll live here?”</p>

<p>“Aye.”</p>

<p>“The great vase you made for the cardinal!
Tall as a man, and a wreath of silver dancers!
And he would have you to sup with him&mdash;and
even I in the hall had venison pasty and marchpane
and such wine as Saint Vulcan drinks!”</p>

<p>“Let us go to the owner.”</p>

<p><em>Five days ago Wander Forest.</em></p>

<p>Owner of the house, heir of the dead man’s
furnishings, was found. Yes, yes! let and sell
on easy terms, Jankin, who was responsible, answering
for Richard or Diccon Dawn, and the
latter’s gold pieces also answering. The long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>June day saw the whole completed, key in the
hand of Diccon Dawn, and still two hours lacking
of sunset.</p>

<p>Quoth Jankin, “I can get you plain work to
start on.”</p>

<p>He stood a middle-aged, surly, doggedly faithful
man. “If you chose to work with me again,
Jankin&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Jankin regarded workroom, regarded street
through wide, low window. “Well, I will! I’d
like to watch tree break flowerpot!”</p>

<p>Through the street alone, into the outer street
near the river, a poor street also, filled with a
great clanging noise. Men-at-arms poured by,
going for some reason to the Tower. When they
were passed he met a country cart, two girls, sisters,
seated and a boy walking beside the horse.
They had strawberries and they were crying
them. “Strawberries! Strawberries! Make
you young again! Strawberries!”</p>

<p>Down a cross street he saw the river and it
was running sunset gold with beds of violets.
He entered a poor house where lodged sailors’
wives, and here he sought and found Morgen
Fay. “Come with me! I want to show you
something.”</p>

<p>After a moment of silence she moved toward
him and they went out together. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>went through the street, a tall man and a woman
very poorly clad, tall almost as he, and of a rich
beauty. There was a great sunset this eve, bathing
London and Thames and these two.</p>

<p>Diccon Dawn opened the door. They entered
the workshop. “This place is now mine. I do
not know if you know it, but I am a smith in gold
and silver.”</p>

<p>Jankin had brought and left upon the table a
loaf and cheese, a pitcher of ale and a platter
heaped with strawberries. Moreover there was
water provided and candles in the stand and he
had swept the room. All the tools of this trade
were about; at the back stood the furnace. The
room faced the south and the west, and through
the window streamed the glowing light. They
entered, they drank a little water, then stood and
faced each the other.</p>

<p>She spoke. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>“We came away upon the ship together,
two mortals in the most merciless danger.
‘That cannot be helped!’ I thought, after the
first astounding when all the blood went from
my heart and my knees bent under me. The <i>Vineyard</i>
shook us down together like two leaves in
London. ‘That cannot be helped,’ I thought,
‘but now the wind will drive the one north and
the other south!’ ‘Lodge at the Old Anchor,’
says <i>Vineyard</i> master. I go there, and I find you
there before me. Still the wind does not rise.
But now it must!”</p>

<p>“You have gold,” said the other. “I saw him
to whom we owe more than gold give it to you.
There is still lodging at the Old Anchor. Return
there if you choose. I will walk with you. You
shall lodge as you have lodged, and I as I have
lodged. But this house is now mine. Lodge
here, Morgen Fay!”</p>

<p>“No! Now at last we speak together! Now
at last!”</p>

<p>“Now at last!”</p>

<p>She stood away from the table, he nearer window.
Gold and red sunset was behind him, a
gold and red pool upon the floor between them,
and a rosy light struck her&mdash;face, head and
throat.</p>

<p>It was again&mdash;it was again!</p>

<p>She cried, “Cell at Silver Cross, and you on
your knees before heaven, and I the ape!”</p>

<p>He put his hands before his face. “All heaven
was mine!”</p>

<p>“Dressed so, like the great picture, and with
my fingers drawing or slackening cords that made
the blue mantle to wave and lights to brighten.
Oh, God&mdash;oh, God!”</p>

<p>“It is so, yet they brighten.”</p>

<p>She leaned against the wall, clasping her hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>above her forehead. “Through wickedness and
mire and hell and silly paradises I could come at
times to her garden gate and feel her within,
though ever was a fence between us! Her the
Blessed, Her the Mother, Mother of All! A
sweet song of her, a bright picture of her is that
one who moved in Bethlehem and went down into
Egypt and came back to Nazareth! A little song,
a little story of her is the great picture in Silver
Cross. All songs and all stories have her in
them! But what <em>I</em> did, because I thought I was
in danger and because there was mire in me, was
to choose to clip the gold coin and take it from
where it was needed and buy perdition with it!
I chose to lie and cheat, to mock and perjure, to
make her small and ugly&mdash;Her the Blissful, Her
the Wholly Pure, Her the Strong and Beautiful!”</p>

<p>Richard Englefield turned to the window.
Fiery light! The moon on the coasts of Italy!
Fiery light!</p>

<p>Moments dropped, far apart, slowly, one after
the other. Morgen Fay spoke again, in a changed
tone. “I am not going back to the old life. To
please myself I learned to make lace and I can
make it rarely. There is here a guild of sewing
women and lace-makers. A sailor’s wife told
me.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>“Work if you will, Morgen. But do you lodge
here!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why?”</p>

<p>They moved. Light seemed to pour over them,
red light. A horn was blown in the street. Again
she cried out. “It is heaven that you love and
seek, far above this and all sinning! When I
was ape I saw that, the light falling on your
face!”</p>

<p>“Heaven, yes&mdash;heaven grown small maybe,
but heaven that man understands! Give me
heaven!”</p>

<p>She cried, “Oh, the ape has done murder!”</p>

<p>“No! No murder was done. I thought so at
first, and indeed it might seem so, but it was not.
<em>Diccon and Alice Dawn.</em> Lodge here, Morgen,
lodge here!”</p>

<p>The fiery light, the music in the street. The
brown-gold figure, the smith in gold and silver,
tall, like King David in the window of Saint
Ethelred. “Decide! It is for you to decide!”</p>

<p>All her life seemed to come around her. All
her life up to the ruined farm and Wander forest,
and then and for a long time Wander forest,
ruined farm. And then in full, sounding and
lighted, Silver Cross. Four times in all. Prison,
the <i>Vineyard</i> ship and the Old Anchor. Fire-red
and brown-gold and shreds and lines of blue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>Horns in the street, but somewhere a lute and a
viol. <em>Build as build you can!</em> <i>Vineyard</i> ship,
Old Anchor, fiery street, house of the smith, colour
and odour of roses, viol, lute. She moved,
she sat down by the table and buried her face in
her arms. Presently he lighted the candles.
“Come, Morgen, come and see the whole of it!”</p>

<p>“No!” said Morgen Fay and rose to her
height. She stood up. “No! It is not little me
thou art seeking&mdash;little me, little thee. Perhaps&mdash;it
is great daring to say it&mdash;perhaps I also
who have been ape am seeker! At any rate, I’ll
not give thee tinsel who needeth gold! And now
I am going back to Old Anchor.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="25">XXV</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Clink</span> of metals striking together, hammer
sound, sound of the wheel, sound of the fed furnace,
sound of voices among metals. Diccon
Dawn, worker in rich metals with Jankin to help
and a boy to help Jankin. All day were voices in
the long room, footsteps to and fro, sound of the
craft. Richard Englefield beginning again to
make beautiful things.</p>

<p>As he worked he saw a lace-maker. Rich and
beautiful lace.</p>

<p>He saw Wander forest, he saw the ruined farm,
he saw Middle Forest, the prison there and the
house by the river.</p>

<p>He worked from dawn to dusk. Work,&mdash;let
some ease come that way! He was artist at
work and some lightening came. One must love
all.</p>

<p>The nights at first brought him long and faintly
terrible dreams. He could not remember them
in sequence, but some had horror and some had
beauty, and now and again his brain caught from
them small, vivid pictures.</p>

<p>Then, one night, he saw, half he thought in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>dream and half not in dream, a furnace and
seated within it a man with a hammer and an
anvil, and on the anvil a man, and they were both
the one man, only the man with the hammer was
the greater in aspect.</p>

<p>Work, work, and at last, after terrible dreams,
pray! But no set prayers, only a wild cry upward
to the man with the hammer.</p>

<p>The street lay baked clay under the sun, the
street darkened beneath cloud. Rain poured
down, cleansing and sweetening, making brooks
of gutters, pattering and driving, singing the
clean and the fresh, turning when out came the
sun into uncounted glistening or rainbow orbs.
Wind swept the street, a great bellows quickening
life. Fog stole in, and the familiar became a
foreigner, strange, remote, chill; surely the world
was dying! Then came the sun, and the world
was not dying.</p>

<p>He went to Old Anchor. The street of half
ruinous houses was filled with a crowd of voices
of sea-going and from-sea-returning folk. A
woman with a child told him where to find her.
She sat with bobbins in her hand, at a lace pillow.
“Thou’rt pale! Weave, weave like this all day
long!”</p>

<p>“So I buy bread. I do well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>“So wretched a place! Morgen, come to my
house. Richard and Alice Dawn&mdash;brother and
sister.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!”</p>

<p>They talked, they parted. Old Anchor and
Thames side and street of the smiths. That
night, lying awake, suddenly he saw her life; he
passed into a calm and wide and lifted moment
and saw it spread from childhood. Seeing so, it
appeared his own experience,&mdash;not appeared,
but was. Something like a great shutter closed
upon that moment, then there opened another as
wide and as deep. Space, there was space! “I
have standing and moving room again!”</p>

<p>After a week he went once more to Old Anchor.
“Morgen, I better understand your life and my
life. This place harms you. Come into the
smiths’ street and to the house where I am and
where there is all room. We have need to be together
and to learn together.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!”</p>

<p>Again he went away. The next day, suddenly,
while he was turning in his hands a bar of silver,
his thoughts for a moment ran gold. He was
back with a certain day in his stone workroom
at Silver Cross and he was making a cup for Abbot
Mark to give to a bishop. The great picture
was in his thoughts, the Blessed among women.
There were rolling fields and the villages of Palestine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Palestine? Everywhere she was, she
was everywhere! That day had been two years
ago. Now again to-day he saw that everywhere
she was, that she was everywhere. Everywhere!
In all realms, upper and lower, afar and
near, great and small. Everywhere. Who had
hurt her? No one and nothing. Naught!</p>

<p>Who had hurt him? No one.</p>

<p>That night he saw a great thorny field and
two wanderers. Each had a great burden on his
shoulders and each a staff. There seemed a path
of pilgrimage. And now one came full upon it
and pursued it and now the other. But they were
not together, and there seemed a desolateness.
Each fell away into the thorns and came again
with toil. The mist closed all away. Again Richard
Englefield prayed. “If it be in God that we
are together&mdash;”</p>

<p>Night passed, day passed. Night again in the
street of the smiths. A light through the window,
a cry in the street, a bell that leaped into clanging.
Fire! Fire!</p>

<p>Diccon Dawn hurrying on clothing, went with
the rest. It seemed to be on the water side and
to the eastward,&mdash;a great fire. When they came
to the Thames they saw that it was a stretch of
old buildings, a maze where the poor lived, together
with seafaring folk. So joined were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>houses that it might be one, or they might be ten.
Old Anchor&mdash;Old Anchor!</p>

<p>The sky was murk and flame, any face might
be read; the fire-ocean leaped in breakers, roared,
licked up and sucked under. All the air was
sound, all the bells were ringing, all the heart was
bursting. Middle Forest! A heap of fagots
by town cross.</p>

<p>Old Anchor, and many heroic things done that
night by men and women and children. But a
man, a goldsmith, entered farthest, endured longest,
brought forth in his arms whom he had gone
to seek, out of the heart of it. “Is she dead?
No! Dead with the smoke, and fire has touched
her arms and her breast and her sides. Who is
she? The man’s sister. Where will he take
her? He will carry her through the street to his
house. Diccon Dawn, a goldsmith. He will
nurse her there&mdash;oh, tenderly, tenderly.”</p>

<p>It was so.</p>

<p>He nursed here there, oh, tenderly, and she
came back to life and to strength through much
suffering.</p>

<p>“It hurts? I would that I could take that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye, it hurts sore! But I will keep it
and bear it and see it change.”</p>

<p>“So much more I know about thee than I used
to know! Thou hast courage.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>“So much more I know of thee. Thou hast
strength, patience. If I moan with the pain, it
helps me to utter it.”</p>

<p>“See thou, it is meant for us to be together.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="26">XXVI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Clink</span> of metals striking together, hammer
sound, sound of the wheel, sound of the fed furnace,
sound of voices among metals. Up and down
this was the strain of the smiths’ street.
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, round went
the wheel.</p>

<p>The street lay hot under the sun, the street
stretched dim and breathless under clouds. Rain
poured down, freshness and song of the sea
drawn into the air. The wind sang his great song
of vigour. Fog came and shut the eyelids of the
world, then passed away and one started as from
sleep. Snow fell in small flakes or in large flakes,
in few or in many. The street lay white, the
roofs white.</p>

<p>All day voices in the long workroom, footsteps
to and fro, sound of the craft, Diccon Dawn fashioning
beautiful things. He had helpers, Jankin
and a boy, and also his sister, Alice Dawn.</p>

<p>There was that which she could do and he
showed her how. Those who came that way in
the smiths’ street saw a brother and sister, a tall
pair, working together. Beside this, she toiled
like all the women in the street. She kept the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>house clean, she bought the food and cooked it,
she took ewer and pail and went to the well. To
and fro, to and fro. At the well were women, in
the street were women. She greeted and answered
greeting. Sometimes she was drawn into
a knot of talkers. But she spoke little herself.
“Alice Dawn? Whence, then? The other end
of England? Thy brother does fine work, they
say. When didst learn to work with him? He
has gotten thee a good gown and it sets thee like
an earl’s wife!” When she was gone they talked
of her. “How old should you think? She has
too still ways for me! She looks like a queen.
Nay, lass, to my thinking like a quean!”</p>

<p>Clink, clink, clink in the street of the smiths.
Water from the well, dashing over the stones,
water brought home in great ewer or pail, balanced
so.</p>

<p>Sometimes at sunset, go, the two of them, down
to the river. Sunday beyond the wall into green
country, into sere autumn country, into winter
country. Mix and not mix with those about them,
live and let live, keeping observation as near as
possible to ebb tide. Live&mdash;let live! Live&mdash;let
live! In this time the herb found some growing
room. Away from the smith’s street they
saw the able king go by with his able men, the
queen with her ladies. They saw the cardinal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>his train. They heard of a Lollard burned, and
they went not there; of a sorceress burned and
they went not there. They went somewhat
silently and softly that day. So long as they ran
not foul of some one’s earthly ambition or his
jealousy or his fear, there was going room. Once
they heard a street preacher mourning that the
time was so lax. A great time, an active time,
but lax, lax! What was this New Learning and
crying that Authority was within? Every day,
somewhere, a monk broke from cloister and a
priest began to babble. For the bookmen, they
were writing perdition! Differers springing up
like weeds, laughter rising, folk prying into vain
knowledge, conceiving a thing called “freedom.”</p>

<p>Clink, clink, clink in the street of the smith.</p>

<p>Diccon and Alice Dawn. Out of blind feeling
there rose, they knew not just when nor how,
desire for that light which is comprehension.
“Tell me&mdash;” “Tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>Breadth by breadth, work of the day done, or
on holidays, they unrolled the bale of old life and
regarded the figures, the outer figures and the
figures of thought and feeling. Each grew to be
to the other a vast and deep and fortunate object
of study. She would say, “When you were in
France, tell me&mdash;” or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>“What like was thy
mother?” And he, “Tell me, Morgen, of thy
childhood and thy girlhood.” Her childhood became
his and his became hers. The like with girlhood
and boyhood. They learned, orb of orb,
ocean of ocean, sharing and growing richer by
the sharing. “I remember” and “I remember.”</p>

<p>“I was a young girl, just over childness. I was
dancing. My father and mother watched. I do
not know if they were truly my father and mother,
but I called them that. They watched me and
they watched the crowd watching. They always
did that. If the crowd did not grow warm, then
afterwards in the booth they beat me. Oh, they
beat me sore! So I always thought <em>into</em> the
crowd as it were and willed it as hard as I might,
‘Oh, love my dancing! Oh, love to look at me!’
I thought it so hard that sometimes it seemed that
the crowd and I were one, and I beat their flame
upward so that they, too, were dancing and liking
it. But I remember that day something beat my
flame upward, too, far upward and very wide!
And the very earth and world was dancing, whirling
and rising like a golden ball in air, and great
figures sat around, laughing and applauding and
crying, ‘You will do! You will do!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Once in Italy, with my master Andrew the
Goldsmith, I was walking alone by olive trees and
blue sea. The sun was low, there was the greatest
beauty! Then gold Apollo walked with me. I
saw him in lines of pale gold, and I felt him a
great god, calm and happy. Vulcan is for the
smiths, but I changed that day to Apollo. Not
that I left Vulcan, but Apollo, too. The next
month I made for Andrew the Goldsmith a cup
which when he looked at he said, ‘Thou’rt accepted!’”</p>

<p>“I remember&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When thou rememberest me&mdash;and I remember
thee&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will we come to remember all?”</p>

<p>Up and down, to and fro in the smiths’ street.
Snow was falling, great flakes, softly, smoothly.
Jankin looked out of window. “Here cometh a
great Blackfriar!”</p>

<p>He walked along the street, a big Dominican
out on his travels. Richard Englefield glanced,
but did not recognize him, though, a moment
afterwards, as he bent to his work, there rose in
mind a picture of Montjoy’s hall the day he stood
there, bound and gagged, like to burst in his rage
and agony. Now he laid hand on graver’s tool
and fell to work. He was fashioning a silver dish
like a shell. Jankin took his cap and cloak and
said good night, for the short day was closing.</p>

<p>Morgen Fay crossed the street in the snow, returning
to the house from some errand. Reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the doorstone, she stood there a little because
of delight in the great white flakes. A friar
spoke to her, “Eh, my sister, a white Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Aye, Brother, they are coming like white butterflies.”</p>

<p>He looked more fully upon her, “Push back
your hood, woman!”</p>

<p>She knew him. “Ah! Middle Forest!” Her
heart stood still, then she changed as she could
expression of her face, roughened her voice.
“Whiter than last Christmas, Brother! That
was a brown one here in London.”</p>

<p>“It was white in Middle Forest!” He stared
in doubt. “What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Alice Dawn, Brother.”</p>

<p>Still he stared, but she saw his uncertainty increase.</p>

<p>“Did ever you have a sister who called herself
Morgen Fay?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I had one named
Mercy.”</p>

<p>“By Saint Thomas, likenesses are strange
things!” said Friar Martin. “There’s something
that binds them together, if we could but get
it clear!” He looked up at the smith’s sign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>“‘Diccon Dawn. Silver and Gold.’ Alice
Dawn! Well, you are like, all the same, so you
had better say your beads, my daughter, and
keep from ill ways! <i>Benedicite!</i>”</p>

<p>He went on through the snowy street.</p>

<p>Diccon Dawn looked up from the fluted shell.
“You are as pale as the snow! What is it?”</p>

<p>“Is Jankin gone, and the boy? Here is Friar
Martin of Saint Leofric’s.”</p>

<p>“Here!”</p>

<p>“In the street. He has gone by. But I know
that he will return.”</p>

<p>Englefield rose from the silver work and they
stood in the dusky room. “Did he know you?”
he asked.</p>

<p>She told.</p>

<p>He said, “It was chance his being here! He
saw what he thought was chance likeness. It
will pass from his mind.”</p>

<p>“It may and it may not. Will there be raised
a cry against me&mdash;against us? Look!”</p>

<p>Hidden themselves, they looked through the
window. Other side the street, in the falling
snow, stood Friar Martin, intent upon the goldsmith’s
house and sign. A man going by was
stopped and questioned. Alone once more, the
friar gazed, dubitated, drew his picture. Diccon?
A Richard made silver dishes for Abbot
Mark. June. He came into this house in June,
and none in these parts had known him before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>And an Alice Dawn like as a twin to Morgen
Fay!</p>

<p>The friar made a movement. “<em>If this be so,
what gain to Saint Leofric?</em>” But first it was
to tell beyond peradventure of a doubt if it were
so! He crossed the smith’s street and with his
staff knocked upon the door of Diccon Dawn.</p>

<p>“Shalt open to him?”</p>

<p>“If I do he may find likeness. If I do not&mdash;”</p>

<p>They stood in the dusky place, a long room with
the red fire eye of the small furnace dully winking,
with the snow falling, falling. The friar
knocked again. “If we do not answer, then
surely will he say, ‘Witch’s house!’”</p>

<p>Englefield moved toward the door, but Friar
Martin, impatient and bold, did not wait, but
lifting the latch, pushed inward. It was dusk,
beyond seeing clearly.</p>

<p>“Are you the smith?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Brother. Can I serve you?”</p>

<p>“I would see your work. But I cannot do so
without light.”</p>

<p>“Work hour and shop hour are over. Best
come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow we may all be dead. Canst not
light candle?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I can.” He took a brand from the fire
and suited action to word. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>“There is not much
here.” He held the candle to the silver shell, but
Friar Martin, who helped himself through life,
shot out his hand and took the taper and held it
to the smith. Diccon Dawn stood in the light
and formed face of London smith who knew
that in these later days friars upon their travels
were what they were and must be taken so. They
had their whims!</p>

<p>But Friar Martin said, “Did ever you wander
by a stream called Wander? Do you know a
town named Middle Forest, and the Abbey of
Silver Cross?”</p>

<p>Diccon Dawn shook his head. “I stick to my
work, Brother. It’s night and snowing fast!”</p>

<p>Light&mdash;light! It seemed to blaze around.
“Didst never make silver dishes for abbots?”</p>

<p>“No. I have a humbler trade. It nears curfew,
Brother!”</p>

<p>“I met a woman upon your doorstep. Your
wife or perhaps your sister?”</p>

<p>“My sister,&mdash;Curfew, Brother!”</p>

<p>The other was thinking, “I do not yet know
wholly, but I guess, I guess!” He said aloud,
“Do smiths have visions? Doth heaven ever
open in this street?”</p>

<p>“All streets are ways to that. Curfew,
Brother!”</p>

<p>It was dusk save for the one taper and the fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>eye in the back of the room. The friar was almost
a giant, but the smith, too, was a strong man,
and somewhere in the house dwelled a witch! He
had matter enough to turn and twist this way and
that, during the night, preparing the vial of
wrath. “Aye, it is late! I will go, having seen
your silver work!”</p>

<p>He went. The street was snowy. His great
sandalled foot made no sound. Going, a little
chime rang in his brain. “I see the gain of Saint
Leofric! I see the gain of Saint Leofric!”</p>

<p>In the dusky room the two moved closer together.
“Thy danger.” “Thine!” “Ah,
our danger!”</p>

<p>“Act, then!” He looked from the window.
“Out of gate ere it is quite night!”</p>

<p>They had warm mantles, good shoes. They
made a packet of food, took coin from the strong
box. Englefield wrote a short letter and placed it
where Jankin should find it the first thing coming
in, in the morning,&mdash;find it, read it and burn it,
though there was naught in it that could harm
Jankin. Jankin and the boy had had their wage
paid that day. Out quietly into the deep twilight,
the snow falling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="27">XXVII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A cot</span> at the side of a wood, and a woodchopper
and his sister who gathered faggots. The owner
of the wood employing them, a miserly old man
in a manor house, kept little company, stirred little
abroad, neither hunted nor hawked. They
had the still wood, the small cot. Sometimes the
steward of the place, sometimes a fellow servant
dropped in upon them, but by no means every day.
Sound of axe, sound of falling tree, sound of
breaking branch and dead leaves underfoot and
of March wind. Hours of toil, then the cot, a fire
on the hearth and homely fare.</p>

<p>Before he became smith he had been lad of
the farm. A cot like this, work like this, was but
an old chime chiming again. She had had a
hardy, difficult childhood. It rose again upon
her at the ruined farm, in Wander forest. Life
of the hand, life of the arm and shoulder was not
new; it was old.</p>

<p>Life of the passions; that was old.</p>

<p>Life of the awakening mind&mdash;life of the
slowly kindling soul&mdash;life passing away from
old life&mdash;that had a divine newness.</p>

<p>The wind murmured and sought, and brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>boughs to strike against wall and roof. Fire
burned on the hearth, light and shadow went
around the room. Some one knocked, then opened
the door. “I am the charcoal burner, I’ve got a
child here who is ill!”</p>

<p>He had him in his arms a thin and gasping
six-year-old.</p>

<p>“It’s his throat, and he’s burning in this cold
wind! He’ll choke to death.”</p>

<p>They laid him on a bed. The charcoal burner
was big and black with a black that brushed off.
“What can ye do to help?”</p>

<p>They helped, but Morgen Fay the most, for she
took the child upon her knees and with long, fine
fingers drew from his throat the stuff that choked.
Through the night she crooned to him, comforted
him, and at the dawn they wiled him to take a
little broth that Richard made, after which he
slept, still in her arms.</p>

<p>“Leave him here till he is well.”</p>

<p>“I do not mind, if you do not mind. He will
give ye a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Leave him!”</p>

<p>They looked after this boy and he became a
great light and play to them. When he was better
they took him with them, wrapped in a mantle,
into the wood and sat him in the sunshine. Diccon
Dawn felled a tree and hewed it into logs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>for the manor house, Alice Dawn brought faggots,
heaping together for the manor cart. When
they must rest they sat in the sun with the boy,
and the great wind rushed and laughed and clattered
in the wood.</p>

<p>“Tell me a story!” said the boy. Richard told
saint’s legend, Christ-child story.</p>

<p>“Now you tell one!” Morgen told the story of
the Great Good Elf.</p>

<p>Afterwards Richard said, “We could not have
told those stories if we were not getting well.”</p>

<p>In the cot at night, in the firelight, again the
boy. “Tell me a story&mdash;tell me a story!”</p>

<p>“All our lives to make these stories. All our
lives of us all!”</p>

<p>“All!”</p>

<p>The child slept, the little flame sang, bough of
tree struck the cot. They sat and seemed to look
down and seemed to look up a road that went
forever.</p>

<p>Wild flowers appeared. The child gathered
them. Morgen wore a knot at her bosom, Richard
one in his cap. “Tell me a story&mdash;tell me a
story!”</p>

<p>The charcoal burner came and took away his
son. He gave rude thanks and said that henceforth
they were friends. They missed the lad
until they found that they had him still.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>The wind pushed the high cloud ships and certain
trees put on their earliest touch of green.
They rested in the wood from chopping and gathering,
and seated upon the felled tree, smelled the
fragrance of the world.</p>

<p>“Tell me a story&mdash;tell me a story&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again within the cot, and the wind fell at purple
twilight, then rose again roaring, and the
flame bent this way and bent that. Quiet together&mdash;still
together.</p>

<p>“What is fire?”</p>

<p>“What is beauty?”</p>

<p>“What is music?”</p>

<p>April air, April wood. Rang the axe, bent and
straightened the faggot gatherer. Showers came
up, but thick fir trees gave shelter. Rain stopped.
Being upon a little eminence in the wood they saw
the great bow, the seven-coloured bridge.</p>

<p>April rain, April greenery, April sunshine.
The axe rang, the tree fell. They rested from
toil, leaning against the sunken mass, and waiting
so, became aware of the movement of horses,
coming nearer through the wood, and presently
of voices. Sit quietly behind branches of felled
tree, and let all go by, at a little distance, five or
six of them!</p>

<p>But they came nearer and nearer, brushing
through the wood, a hawking party from a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>house the other side a line of low hills, cutting off
a distance by leaving the road and crossing this
piece of earth. Nearer and nearer, and presently
it was seen that they would pass the felled tree.
The woodchopper and the faggot gatherer sat
still.</p>

<p>A big man, no longer young, with a beak of a
nose and a waggish yet formidable mouth, a quite
young man and a young woman, and the other
two falconer and helper, carrying the hawks.
They would go pacing by. But the big man
always spoke, sitting his big horse, to woodchoppers
and ditchers and thatchers, charcoal
burners and the like! It was as though one
stopped to observe a robin or wren or blackbird.
“Cousin bird, what have you to say to the so-much-more-than-bird
observing you?” So now
he drew rein and gave greeting.</p>

<p>“Hey, woodchopper, a fine day for felling!”</p>

<p>“Aye, it is, your honour!”</p>

<p>“You fell for old Master Cuddington? He
should stir out, he should go hawking! Is your
mate there weeping or ugly that she sits turned
away, and her face in her hand?”</p>

<p>“It is her way. She means nothing.”</p>

<p>“She seems a fine lass&mdash;should not be in the
dumps! Hey, my girl!&mdash;No?”</p>

<p>“<em>Robins and wrens must not be perverse</em>,” the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>big man said sharply. “Lift your head, woman,
or I shall think you’re hiding the plague!”</p>

<p>She turned upon him a twisted face. Brown
she was and dressed after another fashion than
on a supper time in Middle Forest when the June
eve was cool and a fire crinkled on the hearth,
and Ailsa brought more wine, and Robert Somerville
said, “Morgen Fay&mdash;and hath she not look
of the name?” Brown and dressed poorly and
changed, and yet Sir Humphrey Somerville
stared.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you before, but where? Oh, now I
know where! Well, and is it so!”</p>

<p>He laughed, he seemed about to descend from
his horse and enter into talk, and then to bethink
himself, looking sidewise at his daughter and her
lover. At last it was, within himself, “I’ll think
a while and come quietly again. To-morrow, aye,
to-morrow!” Aloud he said, “Flower garden,
and something about a witch&mdash;but all women
are witches! And so you live now on this side
of the hills? And now I remember me something
of a letter from my cousin, and a great trouble
you were in!”</p>

<p>He looked from her to Richard Englefield, but
having no knowledge there, saw only a brown-gold
woodchopper. Taking a noble from his
pouch he spun it down upon the ground between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>them. “Old Cuddington pays poorly. Seest it?
Vanish not between to-day and to-morrow,
Egyptian!”</p>

<p>He backed his big horse; he and his daughter
and her lover and the men with the hawks rode
on through the wood. Drooping branches came
between; they were hidden, they were gone.</p>

<p>“He thinks that I could not nor would. But
I can and do!”</p>

<p>She stood. “It is Somerville’s cousin. Once
I feasted him in the house by the river.”</p>

<p>They looked deep into the deep wood, they
looked to the cot from which came a tranquil blue
feather of smoke. Then said Englefield, “It is
naught but travel again! Beyond this wood runs
the wold for a long way, then we drop to the sea
and to fishing villages. Come, then! The day is
good, the night is starry.”</p>

<p>“Two Egyptians over the wold.”</p>

<p>“We have been together, I think, upon many
wolds, in woods and havens, in Egypt and elsewhere.
Come then, Morgen!”</p>

<p>They left Master Cuddington’s axe and cords
and cot and furnishing. They took a loaf that
she had baked and a bundle of clothing and what
coins were left from the smiths’ street, and at sunset
fared forth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="28">XXVIII</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> stretched afar, the great wold. They were
out upon it under the moon. All wildness, all
loneliness! If there were a track it was a faint
one. The ground rolled; all opened to the sky, a
little lower and a little higher; around and above
was immensity sewn with points of significance.
They found bushes to shelter them from the murmuring
and seeking wind and slept deeply. The
night turned toward day. Are you awake?&mdash;Aye!</p>

<p>In the east shone the palest light. Huge lay
the wold, and the sky was night save for that far
illuming. Cool hung the air and still, still, still.</p>

<p>The wold began to colour. They ate of their
loaf and took up their bundle and trudged again.
April in the world. They were well together,
with a great natural fitness. It did not matter if
they talked or if they walked a long way in
silence. One was to the other; they accorded.
Once he said, “I have no knowledge how old we
are. This wold is old, our earliest forefathers
trod it, but we were there!”</p>

<p>“Aye! They and ourselves and all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>All lonely was the wold and yet it was filled.
The noon sun turned it gold. They felt a light
warmth, a slight wind, a waving fragrance, a
multitudinous fine sounding. They rested; they
went on again.</p>

<p>A dog came limping toward them, yelping, in
trouble. His paw was hurt, half crushed, apparently,
by some rolling, falling mass. Just
here lay hollow land, with the smallest stream
gliding through. Englefield bathed the paw, set
it right, and they tore cloth and bound it up. The
dog’s wagging tail and his eyes said, “Friends!
I am glad you came!” For a time he kept with
them, but his home was over the wold, and with
a final wag of the tail and lick of the hand, he
left them. They watched him growing smaller
and smaller till he disappeared behind a wavelet
of earth.</p>

<p>The wold hereabouts was wavy, ridged. They
followed the thread of water that had by it a faint
path. Presently it ran beneath a high bank, a
steep, escarped hill. An uprooted tree caught
their eye, then a great heaped disorder of raw
earth. “Look!” said Englefield. “The hillside
has caved and fallen. It was that that caught
the dog.”</p>

<p>The path was covered. They must cross the
streamlet and go around the broken mass. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>had almost cleared it when they saw over the
thread of water a human figure, half buried, unconscious.</p>

<p>They worked until he was free. A leg was
broken, forehead bleeding from a great cut.
They dashed water upon him and he sighed and
opened his eyes, a young man roughly dressed,
with the seeming of fisherman or sailor. “The
hill fell! I was thinking of gaffer and gammer
that I was going to see and the hill fell!”</p>

<p>“Was there any one else?”</p>

<p>“No. ’Tis a lonely place&mdash;a great wold.
There was a dog running about&mdash;not mine. I’m
thankful to ye, but I think my leg’s broken, and
my head is singing, singing.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the wold? Where is the house
you were going to?”</p>

<p>“It’s Gaffer Garrow, the shepherd. There’s
the wold hostel, too&mdash;the Good Man. But it’s
not a good inn&mdash;they be robbers! My head is
singing.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if canst stand. Now arms about
shoulders. So!”</p>

<p>Half carrying him, they followed the stream.
When he failed, Englefield carried him outright.
So they went, very slowly, down the hollow land,
a long way, until they saw Gaffer Garrow’s furze
heap and hut. An old man and woman and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>shepherd lad and a girl came forth to meet them.
“Alack and alack, and Jack, what’s happened?”</p>

<p>Diccon Dawn, it seemed, could set a bone.
When it was done and the sailor on his straw
bed, with gaffer and gammer and younger brother
and sister to his hand, Diccon and Alice Dawn
went on over the wold. The young girl walked a
little way with them to show the way, seeing that
they were going to the sea. “You will come to
the Good Man, but I would not lodge there. Then
you will come to three trees, then will be wold
a long way, then you will smell the sea.”</p>

<p>At turning, she said. “Our Jack might have
died there, earth over him! Our Lady must have
been walking before you. I see Her sometimes in
the even, walking the wold.”</p>

<p>They walked it, the girl returning to her hut,
and they seemed to be alone, except for Silver
Cross rising.</p>

<p>The Good Man topped a low wave of the April
earth. They saw it against cool, blue sky, with
an ash and an aspen pricked out above either end.
Men and women were in the doorway. Richard
Englefield and Morgen Fay went by, though the
host called to them and an urchin came running
after. “Hey! This be the Good Man, the only
hostel this half of wold!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Diccon Dawn shook his head. “We are in
haste.”</p>

<p>“I make guess that ye have not the reckoning!”
The urchin grinned, threw dry turf and
pebble against them and ran away.</p>

<p>Silence came down around them and upon them
and within them. The sun was westering, the
wold growing purple. The stillness became both
fine and vast, a permeating and encirling hush
within the hush. <em>Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait!</em> Out of
it or into it pushed shadowy sorrows, ancient
poignancies. The wold grew peopled with these.</p>

<p>The sun descended. The horizon rose up and
took it; a chill and mournful light spread evenly,
then withdrew, evenly, slowly. It was dusk. The
wold was spectral; all was spectral.</p>

<p>They came to a ring of ancient stones, placed
there long ago by long-ago inhabitants of that
island and now grown about with whin and
thorn and furze. They like the wold, seemed
now eternal, now going away, fading away. It
was to rest here and sleep here; it was the best
place. They lay down. There was silence, and
still&mdash;faint, faint, in dark lines and pallid silver
lines&mdash;rose Silver Cross!</p>

<p>Full night, and descending and climbing stars.
Then the moon, silver, great, mounting above the
clean, sweeping wold-line, silvering the wold, silvering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
all. Now the air was stillness wholly, and
now there came a sighing. Sleep, one must sleep,
weary enough with travelling! Yet sleep was
not in the wold, with all else that was there.</p>

<p>From above&mdash;from above&mdash;oh, from above
come help!</p>

<p>But it seemed there was only the wold and the
air and the moon. Only somehow sorrow.</p>

<p>Deep in the night he perceived that Morgen
Fay had risen from where she was lying by a
great stone and had moved without the ring.
Presently he saw her at some distance, standing
in the open wold, very still, regarding the heavens,
then moving slowly, walking beneath the moon.
A light wave of the wold hid her from his sight.
A momentary dart of fear and loneliness went
through him, as though the wold had taken her,
as though she would go on forever that way and
he this. But no; nothing would come of that,
nothing would come that way! No&mdash;no! They
were together, together in this sadness of the
wold, strangely together in this separateness, together
in the very hauntings and hostilities of the
past; together on this wold, this present night&mdash;together
now&mdash;together to-morrow and the next
day and the day after, together though walls of
the night and the moonlight, or of the day and
the sunlight were between their bodies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>The profound, the starry night. All the stars,
all the moons and the earths, aspects and moods
of a Mighty One! Power, Wisdom, Goodness,
Beauty.&mdash;</p>

<p>Richard Englefield’s body sat still as a stone.
Most is done, seen and felt in a moment. The
vastest takes no time, but the placing of that
moment took time. The wold changed, the night
and day, the here and there, the now and then,
the you and I, all the opposites.</p>

<p>At last he rose and moved out upon the wold.
He did not know which way Morgen had gone,
but she was here, as he was here. He stood with
a deep and quiet heart, looking forth over the
lonely and happy wold. The moon shone, a light
and musical wind rose and fell. He was aware
of an immense tranquility with something of awe
running through like a clean fragrance, like
myrrh. It was so still, it was so wide and deep
and high.</p>

<p>He turned slightly, as though a hand had
drawn him. He saw on the wold the great picture,
the Blessed among women.</p>

<p>Eyes ceased in light. Other eyes opened.</p>

<p>Out of the quiet dark came Morgen Fay and
kneeled beside him. “Let me tell&mdash;for one
instant&mdash;ah, the instant!&mdash;I saw us as the All.
I saw thee in light, and then I saw us as the All.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="29">XXIX</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was still the wold when under pale fine sunshine
they came to a smithy, rude and poor, set
beneath a long wave, where a road went by.
Lonely was the wold, lonely and lonely, yet folk
did travel across it. Here, too, horses must be
shod and cart and wagon mended, though not
many nor often. But the place seemed dilapidated,
the smith an old man. He could not do,
he said, what was needed to be done. Custom, if
you could call it custom, was dwindling; he needed
a helper. He looked at Englefield and said that
he seemed a strong fellow now! “What might
be your name?”</p>

<p>They had changed names when they left Master
Cuddington, that seeming wiser. “Godfrey
the smith, and this is Joan.”</p>

<p>“Smith, now! Can you do this&mdash;and this?”</p>

<p>A middle aged woman called from the hut that
adjoined. “Get them to stay, father, get them
to stay! There be pilgrims a-horseback, coming
by to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Where would we dwell?”</p>

<p>The old man had a gnomish, elfin humour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>“There’s a great empty palace yonder, waiting
king and queen!” He pointed with a shaking
forefinger to a hut a hundred yards away, close
to the earth wave that rose in pale gold, green
and purple and held it as in a cup. Sky hung a
deep and serene blue, sunshine was sifted gold,
spring flowerets bloomed on the wold and all the
bees in the land were humming there. Lonely
and could be well loved, the great wold! Godfrey
the smith looked to Joan.</p>

<p>“Aye, I will it if you will it!”</p>

<p>Great wold and day and night, and the smithy
with the older and the younger smith, and the
lubberly boy that helped, and the few travellers
and comers-by. Work done with satisfaction
and the wold to rest in, walk in, by times. Hut
of the old man and his daughter and the lubberly
boy, hut of Joan and Godfrey, Emmy was the
daughter’s name and she had second sight.</p>

<p>She took to Joan. “You’re eternal. He’s
eternal, too. And so am I. Eternity&mdash;Eternity&mdash;Eternity.”
She went off upon the word into
her own visions.</p>

<p>May and June. “And it was a good day when
you came!” quoth the old man in his throaty,
under-earth voice. “Came to the palace, king
smith and queen lace-woman!”</p>

<p>July, and the wold very rich, and the sunshine
strong and the starry nights soft, immense, musing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
brooding, tender. The wold was a world,
away in space from sister worlds, yet throwing
bridges across, invisible as spider’s thread in sunshine.
July&mdash;August. Gold on the wold, gold
in the sky, gold and sapphire.</p>

<p>September. Said Emmy, “I see some one coming,
riding a bay horse.”</p>

<p>They were walking the wold. “Maybe ’tis to-morrow,”
said Emmy, “maybe next day, maybe
next week. I cannot see his face but he means to
ride to the smithy on great wold.”</p>

<p>The day was golden, golden September. Everything
spread wider, everything lifted higher. All
things had their roots down, down, but all things
climbed and broadened, inviting the air and the
wind and the sun.</p>

<p>“Ah, warmth in light! Ah, light in warmth!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” said Emmy. “The world’s no
so bad if you take it large.”</p>

<p>Back in a great amber twilight to smithy and
huts.</p>

<p>In the morning anvil and iron and hammer.
Glow of fire, sweeping past of wold wind. A man
on a bay horse, a man behind him riding a black
mare, came to the smithy. Richard Englefield,
looking up, met full the eyes of Somerville.</p>

<p>He knew him, remembering him with Abbot
Mark, coming to view him at work, at Silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>Cross. He felt in his hands again a silver bowl,
around it silver vine leaves. Somerville drew his
breath and moistened his lips, then smiled with
oddly twitching face. “Brother Richard&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am Richard Englefield, and here on the
wold Godfrey the smith.”</p>

<p>“When you were woodchopper, seven leagues
yonder, it was Diccon Dawn.”</p>

<p>“Aye, so.”</p>

<p>“There was Alice Dawn, saith my cousin.
Diccon and Alice Dawn. Is she here?”</p>

<p>Englefield, standing, looked afar over wold
and then into the vast, quiet blue sky. “Yes.
Leave horse and man and come with us to the
hill yonder.”</p>

<p>A tiny stream ran by the smithy. He kneeled
and laved his face and hands and arms, dried
them, and moved with Somerville, dismounted,
toward the hut under gold and purple waves of
the wold.</p>

<p>“Morgen!”</p>

<p>She came forth. Wold went into mist, reeled
and was Wander forest and ruined farm. Wander
forest, ruined farm, Robert Somerville.</p>

<p>“Morgen&mdash;Morgen Fay!”</p>

<p>The wold came back, wold and sky and Richard
the smith. More than that. There came, as
it were, a blue mantle around her; she felt an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>arm, a breast, a face looking down, great as the
sky and the earth, supernally fair and filled with
supernal love. “O Mother, All-Mother!”</p>

<p>Richard was speaking, quickly, “Let us go,
Morgen, we three, to the hilltop and talk together
there.”</p>

<p>They went, climbing the earth-wave, to a level
of grass and heath whence one saw all the wold
rippling afar. “Sit down&mdash;sit down!” The
sun shone, the wind went careering. Who will
speak first? They let Somerville do that, who
sat with eyes now on Morgen and now on gold
specks afar in the wold. “Not-change and
change&mdash;and which is the great miracle perchance
the Saints know! I seem to know the
whence, Morgen, but as to the where and the
whither&mdash;”</p>

<p>She said, “Listen, Somerville! There was a
Morgen, there is a Morgen, there will be a Morgen.
‘There will be’ is the ruler. Say that I
died by fire but that I live again pardoned!”</p>

<p>He regarded her. A mist came over his eyes,
the odd, grimacing face worked. Up went a hand
to cover it, then dropped. “Ah, Morgen Fay, I,
too, perchance, must do some dying! I had to
come to find you, but you are safe and safe
enough, for all my finding!”</p>

<p>She said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>“Aye, Rob, do I not know that of
you? Tell me, have you heard aught of Ailsa?”</p>

<p>No, he had not. But he told them this and that
of Middle Forest and Wander vale. Thomas
Bettany? He was well and was wedding young
Cecily Danewood. Middle Forest, Castle, Saint
Leofric, Silver Cross and Westforest. Montjoy,
having made one pilgrimage, was now, they said,
gone another.</p>

<p>The wold rolled afar, sun shone, wind breathed.
Blue sky had cloud mountains. Blue sea, pearl
mountains, and that invisible that held and was
both, and rising with both surpassed. The wind
sang, the fragrance ran.</p>

<p>Richard Englefield told of his life. Boyhood
and the goldsmith, France and Italy, the tall
houses, the seeking, the priest, Silver Cross.
“Now thine, Somerville!”</p>

<p>Awhile ago Somerville would have thought
this impossible, but now, quietly reminiscently, he
spread out for himself and for them Somerville’s
life, dark and light. And then there spoke Morgen
Fay. The clean wind, the dry light, went
about the hill.</p>

<p>“And all was changing all the time, changing
and waking and learning, through earth and air
and water and fire! And now it begins to know
that it wakes and learns&mdash;and that is all, Rob&mdash;and
now are we all born again.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>“Born again,” said Somerville? “Is that
possible?”</p>

<p>“It has happened.” Englefield was speaking.
“And now Middle Forest is dear again, and Silver
Cross is dear again, and street of the smiths
is dear, and Cuddington wood and this wold. And
you and me and Morgen and Emmy yonder, and
all.”</p>

<p>“Is Abbot Mark dear? And is Prior Matthew,
too?”</p>

<p>Godfrey the smith laughed. “Why, when they
wish it we can talk together, being after all one!”</p>

<p>“It is true we talk together,” said Somerville,
“and I feel no anger against you, and you seem to
have none against me.”</p>

<p>“I have none. And beautiful is this day and
restful, here on the hill top. And God is in the
world and here.”</p>

<p>The sun stood at noon. Clean air, dry air,
autumn wealth and rest, and beyond the autumn,
across the winter, spring,&mdash;ever higher, ever
richer, ever with more music! They left the hill
and came to smithy and huts. They gave Somerville
and his man bread and ale, and then the
three said farewell.</p>

<p>Somerville on his bay horse rode over the wold.
Old habit as he rode, horses’ hoofs beating so,
brought forth rhythm and words.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="30">XXX</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wold hung November grey. “Snow in
that cloud,” quoth the old smith. “Elf of the
world wants a white flower!”</p>

<p>“Snowy night a year ago!” said Morgen Fay.</p>

<p>Emmy spoke. “A many are coming by, hurrying,
for they want to get across the wold before
air is white and ground is white.”</p>

<p>So the smiths somewhat looked for many, but
that day passed and the night and part of the next
day and none came. Snow, too, held off. Sky
pallid grey, earth grey, and all unearthly still.
Then a packman came by, going from a town
south of the wold to a town north of it, and he
had news. He had ridden ahead of thirty who
would stop for rest at the Good Man. “Prior
and his monks and so many lay brothers stoutly
armed and mounted. Great church folk changing
visits.”</p>

<p>“Beyond-Wold Abbey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, going there. Have come a long way,
they say, stopping at friaries and castles. They’re
Blackfriars. Ah, it is policy for men to visit
now and then, getting away from home, changing
stories and learning a bit! Prior’s a man like
the rest of us! Tail man told me when I walked
beside him a bit. They’ve got a saint’s bone with
them, and a many poor souls have been healed in
this town and that castle.”</p>

<p>“What like is the prior?”</p>

<p>“Tall bent man, thin as paper, very pale, with
black eyes.”</p>

<p>“That is not Westforest!” said Godfrey the
smith, and looked over the grey wold to see if they
were coming.</p>

<p>Morgen answered, “No, not Prior Matthew.
But it hath a sound of another I have seen going
down High Street and by town cross.”</p>

<p>“Saint Leofric’s Friary,” said the packman.
“Other side England. Aye, bone of Saint
Leofric. Prior Hugh.”</p>

<p>Through grey air a flake fell, then another and
another. “Thirty with him, do you say? Is
there by chance a giant of a friar&mdash;you could
not miss him if he were there&mdash;Friar Martin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye, I think I saw him,” said the packman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>“There was a huge brother bestriding the
strongest horse! Well, I say, say I, black friars,
white friars, grey friars and brown friars are at
times ill as they’re sung, and at times good as
they’re sung, and most times in between the two!
But I say for the most part England’s had
good of them. In the most and for the long
run!”</p>

<p>He was speaking to the brown-gold smith.
That one agreed with him. “I think so, too,
brother&mdash;though I’ve had my buffets&mdash;for the
most part and in the long run!”</p>

<p>The packman had his pony shod and was ready
to depart. Snowflakes were few; he would reach
the end of the wold, the sea and his small haven
before night. He looked at the gold-brown smith,
hesitated, then, “Come ye apart for a word!”
They moved out under the hill. “You’ve got a
fair woman with you. Do you remember a carter
yesterday morn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, he saith at the Good Man that he saw
you in London, you and the woman there, though
you did not see him. He saith a black friar raised
that quarter of London against you and the
woman, but especially the woman for she was a
sorceress. But when they came to the house and
beat in the door, you were gone, the two of you.
There was one Jankin, but he knew naught.
Well, Harry the carter told all that at the Good
Man yestereve. I thought you might like to
know. I might not have told, but she hath a great
look of a sister of mine who’s dead. It is easy to
cry sorcery, and hard to down the cry!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>“Aye, it is. Take our thanks, friend!”</p>

<p>The packman mounted his pony and went away
through the grey day, the few flakes of snow.</p>

<p>“Are you going, too?” asked Emmy. “I see
you over wold and you do not come back. But I
wish you to come back and I must weep!”</p>

<p>“We are pilgrims&mdash;we cannot stay! Some
one has set us a pilgrimage.”</p>

<p>In an hour they had parted with the old smith
and with Emmy. Englefield and Morgen Fay
went over the wold, not by the road, but by a
shepherds’ path, running hereabouts over and between
low hills. From the first of these they
looked back. They could see, almost closely, the
smithy and the hut under the hill. They had
loved this place, loved the wold.</p>

<p>“Love it still and take it with us! So I have
the rose tree and Ailsa and the garden. All
things we love go with us, nor can we ever help
that.”</p>

<p>“So who loveth most hath most treasure!”</p>

<p>They looked back to the smithy and then to the
road that ran almost beneath them on this hill
top. Now they could see approaching a mounted
company, thirty at least, still a good way off but
growing larger with a steady pacing movement.</p>

<p>“Let us watch. They do not dream we are
here. Move yonder and the furze will hide.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>Prior Hugh of Saint Leofric, with him a dozen
monks and the rest stout lay Brothers, rode
thoughtfully, mounted on his white mule. Out
of grey day, athwart the gathering snow, pictures
formed for him. The man and woman above
him, hidden on the hill brow, also saw pictures,
vivid, defined, one after the other. Friar Martin,
huge on huge horse, looked upward as he
passed. They saw his great tanned face, his black
beard wagging ever for Saint Leofric. Loyalties&mdash;loyalties!</p>

<p>There passed Prior Hugh and his following.
Reaching the smithy they halted and dismounted.</p>

<p>Richard Englefield and Morgen Fay went on
over the wold, taking faint, broken paths of shepherds.
The sky was grey and came close, they
saw not a living thing on the wold before them,
the flakes began to fall a little more thickly. An
hour passed, and now they talked together and
now they were silent.</p>

<p>Down came the flakes; the flakes came down.
Now they were white and many, steadily, steadily
falling. Before long they seemed to quicken, they
became a soft vast multitude, they hid as with
curtains the wold all around.</p>

<p>“This is the path?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but there will be a great snow.”</p>

<p>They walked as fast as they might, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>path ran up and down or wound in the trough
of the low waves of whitened earth. They could
not eat the leagues. And ever the snow came
faster. “Three hours yet of daylight. Time
enough to reach Brighthaven. But if the snow
covers the path&mdash;”</p>

<p>The snow covered it. An hour went by.</p>

<p>“We have all the wold for path! But eastward
there lies the sea. And by my reckoning
Grey Farm should be near.”</p>

<p>“The snow cometh so we cannot be sure&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Art warm?”</p>

<p>“Aye.”</p>

<p>Another hour and it was dusk and the snow
came steadily, hugely, and where was sea or east
or west or north or south could no longer be told
with assurance. No house or hut, and now at last
cold, great cold and weariness.</p>

<p>“Grey Farm may be yonder or yonder, but we
cannot see. Lost is but lost&mdash;never forever
lost!”</p>

<p>Night! Cold now and ever falling snow, and
no path or all path. No light, no shape other
than the wold shape and the snow shape and the
night shape.</p>

<p>“Art very weary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, weary!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we lie down here and sleep it will be to part
with life. Let us try awhile longer. Just a fold
of land may keep from us Grey Farm light.”</p>

<p>They tried, but no house or light arose. Only
they heard something after a time.</p>

<p>“Hark to that! What is it?”</p>

<p>“It is the sea!”</p>

<p>It came to sound louder. No lights of haven,
nor could they have seen them, perhaps, behind
the great moving veils and under woldside and
cliff.</p>

<p>“I fear to go farther this way for the cliffs!
We may fall&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It roars, the sea, and there are lights in my
eyes and a singing afar. I must lie down. I cannot
go farther.”</p>

<p>“A little more&mdash;a little more. See! I can
help thee so.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I love thee! But I cannot&mdash;Do you not
hear music playing?”</p>

<p>“Here are bushes bent from the sea. Creep
under&mdash;so! There&mdash;now if we die we die together.”</p>

<p>The falling, falling, falling snow, and at the
base of rock the sounding sea.</p>

<p>“What art thou doing? Take thy cloak
again!”</p>

<p>“No, I am warm, warming thee.”</p>

<p>The snow fell ceaselessly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am not afraid nor suffering now. No fear,
no pain! And thou hast none?”</p>

<p>“None!”</p>

<p>Snow falling&mdash;snow falling. The great sea
sounding and sounding.</p>

<p>“Richard, there are violets. It is Wander
forest, but so changed.”</p>

<p>In the night the snow ceased to fall. Dawn
came like a white rose, the shredded petals covering
all the earth.</p>

<p>A small and humble House of Carmelites, set
upon a cliff a league from Brighthaven, kept a
goodly habit. After tempest, after snow on wold,
it sent out so many Brothers seeking if there were
any harmed. So on this morning as of fine white
wool these at last came upon the cliff brow and to
a line of furze bushes mounded white. They
would have passed them by, for all the earth was
heaped with snow and no footprint anywhere
save their own deep ones. But a young Brother
saw a bit of blue mantle. “Oh, here!”</p>

<p>With their hands they beat away the snow and
with their arms they lifted. The man and woman
moved feebly. They lived, though in an hour,
maybe, they would not have lived. The Brothers
bore them to the House and made for them
warmth and cheer. Life flowed again, red came
to the lip, light to the eyes, strength to the frame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>They rested through that day and night in the
guest house of the monastery.</p>

<p>The Prior was a saintly man, big of frame,
simple and wise. The second morning the two
stood before him to give him thanks and say
farewell. He looked at them somewhat long before
speaking. “You are goodly to look upon,”
he said. “I see that you have been through
much and will go through more before heaven is
complete. But you are bound for heaven and
Who dwells therein. Take and give blessing!”</p>

<p>The wold was silver, the sea blue, the sky blue
crystal. The road shown, they went forth from
the Carmelites to come to Brighthaven. They
walked hand in hand. “How beautiful is the
world!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="31">XXXI</abbr></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord of Montjoy returned from his second
and greater pilgrimage. This time he had
seen Jerusalem. He was palmer. Bit of palm
was wrought into his sleeve, stitched into his hat.
The Lady of Montjoy held his castle for him, his
son-in-law, young Isabel’s baron, giving advice
across five leagues. Montjoy had been gone nigh
three years, for once, taken prisoner by the
Turks, he had been held three months in noisome
prison, and once fever had taken him captive, and
once shipwreck and a desert strand had held him
long. Now, returning, he had come through
Italy and through France, alone and afoot, for
that was his pilgrimage. Now he moved across
Brittany. There were many shrines in Brittany,
and it held him while he went from the one to the
other. But he neared the sea coast and the port
where he would take ship for England.</p>

<p>A slight dark man with earnest seeking eyes,
wrapped in palmer’s grey with palmer’s hat and
staff and scrip, walked a Brittany road, and pictures
of his travels walked with him. They were
many, as though a lifetime had been spent between
castle of Montjoy and Jerusalem wall and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>back again. So many that they must come like a
breadth of the earth between him and the pictures
of three years gone, or five years gone, or more.
That was true, but now and then breadth of earth
became cloud merely; cloud parted, and there
were ancient pictures fresh again.</p>

<p>Now for days they were English pictures.
“Because I am nearing home! They come out to
meet and greet me.” But while they were clear
they came also into company of later pictures.
His castle knew thousand other castles, his town
multitude of other towns; Silver Cross and Westforest
many and many abbeys and priories. And
the palmer, having grown, could in a measure
hold all together and look out upon and through
them. So with the palmer’s whole life.</p>

<p>Montjoy travelled seaward. The day was
bright and Brittany had to him a flavour of home.
Moreover at dawn had come Isabel. She seemed
now to float by his side, her feet just above the
grey road. Twice it had been so in Italy, thrice
in the Holy Land. It had been a small thought,
that holding her confined to castle there above
Middle Forest, or to church of Silver Cross
where lay only her old robe, or to this or that
faint ring in time! She was everywhere and
every time. She was living, she was with him,
here, now!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>“For I, too, change into that space and time,”
thought Montjoy.</p>

<p>Silver Cross, when he came to look at it, still
was dear. He regarded it tranquilly within and
without. There sat Mark, yonder moved the
Brothers. The church filled, they chanted, windows
became sheets of jewels, the great
picture glowed, light washed the sculptured tomb
beneath which lay, sunken into earth, that which
was not Isabel. Here moved her spirit, near him
on Brittany road&mdash;enough, enough of her spirit
to make Promise into a glowing rose!</p>

<p>Light washed Silver Cross that was five hundred
years old and might have five hundred more
to live. In a thousand years there was good and
evil, but more good than evil. Even had that
strange tale of five years agone been found to
have in it some truth&mdash;had there been canker&mdash;still,
still, not always had there been canker,
nor would there be always! Canker was never
the last word. If there had been canker there at
Silver Cross, or more or less? He did not know,
he could not tell if it were so. His mind, pondering
long, had seen certain things&mdash;but he did
not know. He must let it alone and, anyhow,
go a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Almost five years. The palmer had grown.
He saw them now in a pattern, Silver Cross and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>Saint Leofric and Westforest. Then light came
through the pattern and melted all into a stronger
and finer thing. Just as Isabel moved more golden,
finer, more real, for all that when he put
forth hand, hand did not touch. Spirit touched.
Just as in Bethlehem of Judea, one starlight
night, he had become aware that if the kingdom
of Heaven was within, then was within
also the Supernal Mother and Bride, within also
the Christ.</p>

<p>Montjoy, a grey figure, walked the grey road
and thought he heard the sea. It was early morn,
and a rose stole into the world. As he walked the
pictures lifted, stood and passed.</p>

<p>He had grown so that without any conscience
pang at all he was glad that Morgen Fay had not
been burned there by town cross. They had
lighted the fagot pile, anyhow, for perchance it
might make her suffer, the witch flown away
with the demon! It had burned away in smoke
and flame, but now for long he knew it had not
harmed her. Harming and healing were not just
as men thought them! Morgen Fay. Where
was she? He saw her behind circumstance, like
Isabel, like the great picture, like herself, like
Morgen Fay. And Morgen Fay, neither, had
been just as he thought her. Seeing further he
might see her still more really, as he now saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Montjoy and Silver Cross and all things else
more really.</p>

<p>The sea sounded, and he came over white
road to sight of it. Below lay a fishing village;
he saw the nets and the boats. A small, poor place
it was, but it had the salt of the sea and the rose
of the morning. Montjoy, coming down to it,
found himself on clean sand and the tide coming
in. Certain boats were up and away, he saw
their deep-coloured sails standing out between
sand and horizon. Others for reasons bided this
day in haven. Two or three were drawn upon the
beach, and here, too, above the tide a new boat was
making. About this was gathered a small crowd
of folk, perhaps a score in all. As Montjoy came
near he saw that they were listening to one who
spoke, standing upon the sand among the shavings
and chips, underneath the clean bowsprit.
Some were from other boat or from work upon
the nets or from the line of houses. A score, perhaps,
seated and standing, eyes turned to the
speaker.</p>

<p>The sea, ancient, youthful, made her everlasting
song. Air breathed salt and fresh, colour
was rife. Boats, houses, the incoming wave, the
line of low cliff, fell into picture. Montjoy has
seen so many! Could he have painted he might
paint forever and only begin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<p>He heard a voice speaking, a voice with quality,
that somehow stirred the pictures. They trembled,
pushed slightly by others behind. “Love
and understand! Lay hold where you can, begin
where you will!”</p>

<p>He asked a woman leaning against a boat near
the new boat. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>“It is the smith Richard. He dwelleth in town
a league away, but at times he cometh this way.”</p>

<p>“Is he preaching?”</p>

<p>“No. But he talketh to us at times.”</p>

<p>“He uses your tongue well, but still I would
say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, he comes from over the water.”</p>

<p>Montjoy moved into the ring of fisher folk. A
great flapping hat of palmer shadowed his face.
Those about saw straying pilgrim and gave him
room.</p>

<p>Richard a smith, not Breton but English. A
tall, gold-brown, simple-seeming man, strong
enough, quiet enough, loving enough of face&mdash;and
now level ray of the morning sun lighted his
face.</p>

<p><em>He did not drown in Wander!</em></p>

<p>How much was true and how much was mistake
of the much that the many found to say?
Like the thunder and murmur and waves of the
sea rose within voices and voices and yet voices.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>Abbot Mark’s voice Prior Matthew’s, Prior
Hugh’s, Friar Martin’s, Father Edmund’s, the
Hermit by the Old Burying Ground, Brothers
Andrew and Barnaby, Anselm’s, Norbert’s, Somerville’s
voice, voice of Master Eustace Bettany
and of young Thomas Bettany, voice even of
Godfrey the gaoler, voices of pilgrims chanting,
Middle Forest’s voice, voices of Silver Cross,
voices of his own squires and castle folk, voice of
Westforest and Wander vale. Voice of Morgen
Fay. Further back, voice of Isabel, and then
again the heavy waves. “O God, <em>Thy</em> voice!”</p>

<p>The hubbub sank away. The tide came in with
a quiet rhyme. Morning sand shone in a great
golden stillness. Village and sea and boats held
in contentment. The fisher folk sat or stood,
listening. The speaker was speaking, Montjoy
a pilgrim, listening, agreeing. Quiet and the salt
air and the sun. Quietness and certitude. <em>I am,
from everlasting to everlasting.</em></p>

<p>The gold-brown man ceased his speaking or
his answering questions, for it had been largely
questioning and answering. Lifting a bundle
that lay beside him he looked to a league-distant
point striking out into the sea, where seemed
more houses than were here. One of the fishermen
spoke. “I’ll take you, master, in the <i>Nightingale</i>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>The small sailboat carried the palmer also,&mdash;the
palmer and Richard the smith and two boatmen.
The latter were still for questions. “You
have been to Jerusalem? What like is it?”</p>

<p>“It is so and so,” answered the palmer. “But
I say with this man, ‘Let us now build the New
Jerusalem!’”</p>

<p>The smith turned to him, “There is something
in your voice, friend&mdash;”</p>

<p>The red sail and the blue sea, the salt, and the
divine fresh morning. “Is there?” answered
Montjoy. “And there is something in yours&mdash;”</p>

<p>The other said in English, “Naught’s impossible
ever! A long pilgrimage from an English
castle?”</p>

<p>“Aye, brother! At Avignon I was shown a
great cup made in Paris fifteen years ago by the
English goldsmith, Englefield.”</p>

<p>The town in front of them was growing larger.
The younger boatman had still his questions about
Galilee and Olivet. The fresh wind carried the
boat fast. Here was a long wharf and the town,
and quitting the <i>Nightingale</i>, and thanks and
partings with the boatmen, then a street and tall
houses heaping toward a castle on the hill. “The
lady of the castle loveth pilgrims,” said Englefield.
“And yonder is the great house of the
Franciscans.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<p>“If I may I would go with you.”</p>

<p>“As you wish, Montjoy.”</p>

<p>Folk were about them, voices and movement.
“Is there a quiet place?”</p>

<p>“There is an old garden at the edge of the
town, over the sea.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go there.”</p>

<p>They went. Pine trees sighed around, earth
lay carpeted with purple needles. They sat beneath
a very great tree, and saw as from a window
azure ocean, and a great ship, white-sailed,
making into the west.</p>

<p>“I have been far, far without,” spoke Montjoy,
“but farther, farther within. When I used
to watch you at Silver Cross I believed in you.
Again, listening by the boat yonder, I believed.
I have made a journey and come where I was not
before. And still I journey. I can listen now to
whatever you may tell me. Listen, and maybe
understand.”</p>

<p>“I have made a journey, too, Montjoy, and
come where I was not before.” He took up a
handful of purple needles and let slip quietly away
while he talked. He told their story,&mdash;his story
and Morgen Fay’s.</p>

<p>The pine grove stood above the sea, speaking
always with a multitudinous low voice. Far and
far, deep and deep, stretched Mother Ocean. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>white ship, purposeful, still and sure, sped its
way from haven unto haven. The great vault of
heaven held all.</p>

<p>“You are together, you and Morgen Fay?”</p>

<p>“Aye, together.”</p>

<p>From the grove might be seen the high roofs
of the town climbing to a huge, four-towered
castle.</p>

<p>“I work again as goldsmith, making for who
will buy. Yonder you may see the roof of our
house. An old workman of mine, now palsied
and helpless, lives with his brother in that fishing
village. On a holiday, as this is, I walk to see
him. It has come about that I may talk to folk
here and there&mdash;in that fishing village and elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Is there no danger in that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! But those who have lived and suffered
and learned through living and suffering,
may help. So with Morgen Fay and so with me.”</p>

<p>“I would see her if I might.”</p>

<p>“Come then and sleep this night in the smith’s
house.”</p>

<p>They went there. A small, timbered house, one
story overhanging another, old, quiet, with the
castle soaring above and the bell of the church
of the Franciscans ringing near. Within, in a
dusky wide room, rose from her book Morgen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Fay, jewel-like, rose-like, flame-like. Montjoy,
looking, saw nothing that wounded Isabel, nor
that wounded the Reality behind the great picture
at Silver Cross.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
